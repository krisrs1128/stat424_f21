1. The trouble with $2^{K}$ designs is that the number of samples required grows
exponentially with the number of factors $K$. The differences between 4 and 7
factors doesn’t sound like a lot, but it’s the difference between 16 and 128
experimental runs. Fractional factorial designs show how to study extra factors
without having to make as many runs. There is no free lunch, but the tradeoffs
that it creates are often worth it.

### Principles

2. There are two central ideas,
  * Sparsity of Effects: It’s often safe to assume that high-order interactions
  are rare.
  * Heredity: It is unusual for an interaction to be significant without the
  corresponding main effects also being significant. For example, it would be
  unusual to have $A \times B$ be significant without at least one of $A$ and $B$
  being significant.

### Initial Exploration
3. Suppose we want to study $A, B$ and $C$, but we only have a budget of 4 runs.
We need to choose four corners of the cube to sample. Some choices are obviously
bad. E.g., if we chose all the samples on one face, we wouldn’t see any
variation in one factor. Here’s an idea that will lead us on the right path.
Recall our old notation,

| label | A | B |  AB |
|--- | --- | --- | --- |
| (1) | - | - | + |
| a | + | - | - |
| b | - | + | - |
| ab | + | + | + |

```{r, fig.cap = "A bad choice of samples to subset down to, which would make it impossible to estimate effects from $C$."}
include_graphics("https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/gu87vet64i970eonsbvtds7bsb31qbuy.png")
```

4. Acting on the sparsity of effects principle, let’s suppose that AB is null
and invent a contrast for C that exactly matches AB. We’ll update the label to
match the associated corner of the cube.

| label | A | B |  AB | C |
|---| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (c) | - | - | + | + |
| a | + | - | - | - |
| b | - | + | - | - |
| abc | + | + | + | + |

```{r, fig.cap="A more sensible fraction of samples to take."}
include_graphics("https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/mmj9mcixl4y0o95hwf7h93vayw0eooc0.png")
```

5. This seems like a reasonable choice of 4 corners, making it possible to
estimate at least all the main effects. This turns out to be a general strategy
for subsetting the full design. But before we do another example, we need to
define some vocabulary.

### Vocabulary

6. $2^{K - 1}$: This denotes a fractional factorial design where we take
$\frac{1}{2}$ of the samples in a $2^{K}$ design.

7. Aliases: Above, we assumed that AB was null. Suppose that it weren’t, though.
Notice that the contrasts used for the pairs below are all equal,
\begin{align*}
	 \left[AB\right] &= \frac{1}{2}\left(c - a + b + abc\right) = \left[C\right] \\
		\left[BC\right] &= \frac{1}{2}\left(-c + a - b + abc\right) = \left[A\right] \\
		\left[AC\right] &= \frac{1}{2}\left(-c - a + b + abc\right) = \left[B\right]
\end{align*}
  and we have no conclusive way of distinguishing between these *aliased* effects,
  besides appeals to the hereditary principle or domain knowledge. To denote this
  unidentifiability, we will use bracket notation, for example,
  \begin{align*}
  \left[A\right] &= A + BC.
  \end{align*}
  
8. Generators: In the example, we set $C = AB$. Multiplying both sides by $C$
and using the fact that $C^2 = I$, we find $ABC = I$. The *word* ABC will be
called the generator for this fraction.

```{r, fig.cap = "An example complementary fraction."}
include_graphics("https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/pffnjyav7wexbujzf32vlhorcfxhfa6w.png")
```

9. Complementary designs: The complementary fraction of a fractional factorial
design are the corners on which we didn’t take samples. Often, if there are
strong aliased effects in an initial fractional design, the complementary
fraction will be run in the next experiment.

10. Resolution: A fractional design has resolution $R$ if no $p$-factor is
aliased with an effect containing less than $R - p$ factors.

| $R$ | $p$ | $< R - p$ | Interpretation |
|- | - | --- | ------- |
| 3 | 1 |  $\leq 2$ | Main effects aren't aliased with other main effects, but could be aliased with two-way interactions | 
| 4 | 1 | $\leq 3$ | Main effects aren't aliased with any other main effects or with any two-way interactions, but could be aliased with three-way interactions | 
|  | 2 | $\leq 2$ | Two-way interactions aren’t aliased with main effects.
| 5 | 1 | $\leq 4$ | Main effects aren’t aliased with other main effects, two-way, or three way interactions. | 
| | 2 | $\leq 3$ | Two-way interactions aren’t aliased with with main effects or two-way interactions. |

11. Projection: In a fractional factorial, if we decided that we don’t care
about a factor after all, we automatically end up with a $2 ^ {K - 1}$
full-factorial for free.

```{r fig.cap="Three projections of $2^3$ designs into $2^2$ designs, from the textbook."}
include_graphics("https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/b94hfeyugeun1xywlm2ccls9am5l38xg.jpg")
```

12. Sequences: If we find a strong contrast for an aliased effect, it’s natural
to try a follow-up experiment to resolve the ambiguity.

### Code Example

13. Let's suppose we only had only run half of the runs in the filtration
example from week 9 [1]. The original experiment is a $2^ 4$ design; we will
choose the fraction corresponding to the word^[The word $I = ABCD$ emerged from
defining $D = ABC$.] $I = ABCD$.

14. This is a general principle for $2 ^ {K - 1}$ designs: choose which
configurations to run by defining the relation $K = A B C \dots J$. This turns a
full $2^{K - 1}$ factorial design, which only studied $K - 1$ factors into a
fractional $2^{K - 1}$ factorial that studies $K$ factors.

```{r}
opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

15. Let's read the filtration dataset and pretend that we had only collected
data corresponding to the fraction specified by $D = ABC$. This is exactly what
the `filter` command does below -- it removes all samples that are not
consistent with the $D = ABC$ fraction.

```{r}
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
code <- function(x) ifelse(x == '-', -1, 1)
filtration <- read_table2("https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/xxh05ngikmscnddbhg2l3v268jnu4jtc.txt") %>%
  mutate_at(vars(A:D), code) %>%
  filter(D == A * B * C)
```

16. We can perform the fit. Note that there missing values in the estimated
coefficients because some effects are aliased.

```{r}
fit <- lm(Rate ~ A * B * C * D, data = filtration)
summary(fit)
```

17. To back out which terms are aliased, let's look carefully at the design
matrix. All `TRUE` elements outside of the diagonal are aliased effects. For
example, the `TRUE` in column A on row BCD means that A is aliased with BCD.

```{r}
X <- model.matrix(fit)
t(X) %*% X != 0 # TRUE on off diagonals are aliases
```

  So, revisiting the estimated fit, we can conclude that.
  \begin{align*}
  \widehat{\mu}+\widehat{A B C D} &=70.75 \\
  \widehat{A}+\widehat{B C D} &=9.5 \times 2=19 \\
  \widehat{B}+\widehat{A C D} &=0.75 \times 2=1.5 \\
  \widehat{C}+\widehat{A B D} &=7 \times 2=14 \\
  \widehat{D}+\widehat{A B C} &=8.25 \times 2=16.5 \\
  \widehat{A B}+\widehat{C D} &=-0.5 \times 2=-1 \\
  \widehat{A C}+\widehat{B D}=&-9.25 \times 2=-18.5 \\
  \widehat{B C}+\widehat{A D} &=9.5 \times 2=19
  \end{align*}
  
18. Let's see which of the effects are important, and see whether we can draw
any reasonable conclusions, based on the hereditary principle.

```{r, out.width = 600}
daniel_plot <- function(effects, probs = c(0.4, 0.6)) { 
  qq <- qqnorm(effects, datax = TRUE)
  qqline(effects, col = "red", probs = probs, datax = TRUE)
  text(qq$x, qq$y, names(effects), pos=1)
}

daniel_plot(2 * coef(fit)[-1], prob=c(0.25, 0.3))
```

19. The important effects look like,
  
  * $A + BCD$ 
  * $BC + AD$
  * $D + ABC$
  * $C + ABD$
  * $AC + BD$
  
  It seems like we should believe in the main effects $A, D$, and $C$. For the
  two-way interactions, $AC$ and $AD$ are more plausible, because the main effect
  for $B$ was not significant.
