1. In section 6.7, we said that if we wanted an optimal design, we should place
all our test points at the boundaries of factor’s values. This is certainly true
when we have a linear factor effect. But what if the linearity assumption
doesn’t hold? Which design should we pick?

```{r, fig.cap="The main lesson from section 6.7", out.width = 300}
include_graphics("https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/n751tnavv2xgg50cj3z535t3s3dsbel0.png")
include_graphics("https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/g6ge54chmmlv1guftm15fz4o4j8dz7ek.png")
```

2. At least in the first design, we would know that something is off! We could
then include polynomial terms to fit curvature in the factor effect. This
motivates the addition of _center points_.

```{r, out.width = 300, fig.cap="What if our effect is nonlinear?"}
include_graphics("https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/6s1qw3mjzok5zrm7l384undexkb2ga2u.png")
include_graphics("https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/z0rpppgsnte77f3vsl5dsrbvtyrtqne0.png")
```

```{r, fig.cap="Added center points in the $K = 1$ and $K = 2$ cases.", out.width = 300}
include_graphics("https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/53o5ytugsbmpgvxcwmfy6053dfvrh3kv.png")

```

### Testing

3. It’s possible to formally test whether there is significant quadratic
curvature in the factor effect. We can add quadratic terms to our model and
perform ANOVA on the associated term. Alternatively, we can look at
  \begin{align}
  SS_{\text{curvature}} &= \frac{n_{F}n_{C}\left(\bar{y}_{F} - \bar{y}_{C}\right)^2}{n_{F} + n_{C}}
  \end{align}
  where $\bar{y}_{C}$ is the average of the $n_{C}$ samples at the center point
  and  $\bar{y}_{F}$ is the average over all other points. A large value suggests
  that linearity is not plausible, and it turns out that it can be formally used
  in a $t$-test, but we will not develop that point further, since it's only in
  the supplemental material for the chapter.

```{r, fig.cap = "Geometry of the curvature test statistic."}

```

### Central Composite Design

4. If we have an unreplicated design, then we cannot fit quadratic terms — we
would have more parameters than samples, and the linear system would be
underdetermined.
  * A fix is to require samples at axial points.
  * This design is called a _central composite_ design.
