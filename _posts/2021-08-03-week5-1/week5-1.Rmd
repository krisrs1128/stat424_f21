_Readings [4.1](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Design+and+Analysis+of+Experiments%2C+10th+Edition-p-9781119492443#content-section), [Rmarkdown](https://github.com/krisrs1128/stat424_f21/blob/main/_posts/2021-08-03-week5-1/week5-1.Rmd)_

1. How can we generalize the idea of pairing to the case that we have more than
two treatments to compare? Suppose that the nuisance factor is known and
controllable. For simplicity, also assume that the blocks have the same number
$a$ of samples as we have treatments ($a=2 \to$ pairing)

2. _Example [page 120]_. A medical device manufacturer creates vascular grafts,
and wants to see the effect of manufacturing pressure on defect rate. But the resin
used to make the graft arrives in batches, and may itself contribute to defects.

> Idea: Randomly assign each of the a treatments to the units within each block. This is called the RCBD.

3. This is a restriction on randomization. Only random treatment assignments
where each block has each treatment are allowed. In the medical example, we
would test all the manufacturing pressures on each of the resin batches, rather
than having batches that receive only subsets of pressures. The figure below
shows how this relates to pairing. In the left-hand case, one of each pair of
treatments (different colors) is given in each block (rectangles). The right
hand case generalizes this logic to three treatments.

```

### Model Setup

4. For hypothesis testing, we need a probability model. We suppose
$$
y_{ij} = \mu + \tau_i + \beta_{j} + \epsilon_{ij}
$$
  where $\epsilon_{ij} \sim \mathcal{N}\left(0, \sigma^2\right)$ independently
  and $\sum_{i}\tau_i=\sum_{j} \beta_j=0$ is required to ensure identifiability.
  
```{r, fig.cap = "An example of a dataset generated by the model with block effects."}
include_graphics("https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/rp2oe5pq19cxxvgps7hie04c3tni14r2.png")
```

5. As before,
  * $\mu$ is a global mean
  * $\tau_i$ is the treatment effect for the $i^{th}$ treatment level
  * $\epsilon_{ij}$ is the error term
  
  But now we also have
  * $\beta_{j}$, the effect of the $j^{th}$ block

6. Notice that in each block, we must have exactly $a$ samples, one from each
treatment.

```{r, preview = TRUE, fig.cap = "Annotation of the previous dataset using terms from the model."}
library(EBImage)
display(readImage("https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/fgtpgaimnwwlm5s63bmj9f8ahe1nq4qp.png"))
```

### Hypothesis Testing

7. We’re interested in whether any treatments have an effect,
\begin{align*}
H_0 &: \tau_1 = \dots = \tau_a = 0 \\
H_{1} &: \tau_{i} \neq 0 \text{ for at least one } i
\end{align*}

8. There’s a useful decomposition of the total variance that accounts for block-to-block variation,
\begin{align*}
\sum_{i = 1}^{a}\sum_{j = 1}^{b}\left(y_{ij} - \bar{y}_{\cdot\cdot}\right)^2 = &b\sum_{i = 1}^{a} \left(\bar{y}_{i\cdot} - \bar{y}_{\cdot\cdot}\right)^2 + \\
& a \sum_{j = 1}^{b}\left(\bar{y}_{\cdot j} - \bar{y}_{\cdot\cdot}\right)^2 + \\
&\sum_{i = 1}^{a}\sum_{j = 1}^{b} \left(y_{ij} - \bar{y}_{i\cdot} - \bar{y}_{\cdot j} + \bar{y}_{\cdot\cdot}\right)^2
\end{align*}
  We’ll abbreviate this as $SS_{\text{Total}} = SS_{\text{Treatment}} + SS_{\text{Block}} + SS_{E}$.

9. The corresponding mean squares are,
  * $MS_{\text{Total}}= \frac{1}{N - 1}SS_T$, which is the sample variance of all $y_{ij}$
  * $MS_{\text{Treatment}}=\frac{1}{a - 1}SS_{\text{Treatment}}$
  * $MS_{\text{Block}}=\frac{1}{b - 1}SS_{\text{Block}}$
  * $MSE=\frac{1}{(a - 1)(b - 1)}SS_{E}$, which a good estimator for $\sigma^2$

10. As in usual ANOVA, if $MS_{\text{Treatment}}$ is much larger than MSE, then we have evidence against the null hypothesis. In fact, it turns out that, under the null,

$$
\frac{MS_{\text{Treatment}}}{MS_{E}} \sim F\left(a - 1, \left(a - 1\right)\left(b - 1\right)\right)
$$
so we can reject the null hypothesis if this statistic is larger than the $1 - \alpha$
quantile of an $F$ distribution with $(a - 1, (a - 1)(b - 1))$ d.f.

### Code Example

11. In this code example, we'll study a vascular graft data. We want to know the
effect of pressure on yield, controlling for possible batch effects. We first
download the data and reshape it so that batches are not spread across columns.
Judging from a plot, there might be batch effects; for example, the purple batch
seems to have a lower yield across all pressure levels.

```{r}
opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
library(readr)
library(tidyr)
graft <- read_table2("https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/0ciblk4z2f3k6zizbj4plg3q33w1d0n6.txt") %>%
  pivot_longer(-Pressure, names_to = "batch", values_to = "yield")
graft$Pressure <- as.factor(graft$Pressure)

ggplot(graft) +
  geom_point(aes(x = batch, y = yield, col = Pressure)) +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set2") # custom color scheme
```

12. We can use the `lm` function to fit the RCBD model. As before, the response
goes on the left hand side, but now the right hand side includes both the
variable of interest (`Pressure`) and an indicator of which batch each sample
came from (`batch`). We can build an ANOVA table for the expanded table using
the same `aov` table as before.

```{r}
fit <- lm(yield ~ Pressure + batch, graft)
summary(aov(fit))
```

13. It appears that there is a significant batch effect. Controlling for this
effect, we are able to detect a significant relationship between pressure and
yield. Note that the results are identical to those in Figure 4.2 of the
textbook.

14. If we hadn't controlled for the batch effect, we would have still seen this
relationship, but we would have lower power (the $p$-value is not as low here as
it had been before).

```{r}
summary(aov(lm(yield ~ Pressure, graft)))
```
