1. What can we do when the errors seem very far from normally distributed?
Imagine all attempts to transform the data have failed. An alternative is to use
nonparametric ANOVA.

```{r, preview = TRUE}
library(EBImage)
display(readImage("https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/kdv2ayi2heooodf0a0j15swxld4ofll7.png"))

2. The intuition is that, if all the groups have the same means, then no group
should be consistently ranked higher than another. To implement this idea
quantitatively,
  * Transform the data to their ranks. The smallest of the $y_ij$ becomes 1, the
next smallest becomes 2, etc. Denote these ranks by $R_{ij}$. 
  * Compute the test statistic
$$
\frac{1}{S^2}\left[\sum_{i = 1}^{a} \frac{R_{i\cdot}^2}{n_{i}} - \frac{N\left(N + 1\right)^2}{4}\right]
$$
  where we define $R_{i\cdot}$ to be the sum of the ranks in the $i^{th}$ group,
and
$$
S^2 = \frac{1}{N - 1} \left[\sum_{i, j} R_{ij}^2 - \frac{N\left(N + 1\right)^2}{4}\right].
$$
  * Compare the test statistic to a $\chi^2_{a -1}$ reference distribution. If
  it seems too large to be plausible, reject the null hypothesis.

3. Where did this test statistic come from? It’s possible to show that the statistic is equivalent to

$$
\frac{\sum_{i} n_{i}\left(\bar{R}_{i} - \bar{R}\right)^2}{\frac{1}{N - 1}\sum_{i, j} \left(R_{ij} - \bar{R}\right)^2}
$$
which compares the average rank in group $i$ to the average rank overall, and
standardizes by the overall variance of the ranks. The first formula is the one
presented in the book, though, and it’s easier to calculate by hand.

4. Why not always use nonparametric ANOVA? If the data are actually normal, than
this approach has less power than standard ANOVA. If you have doubts about
validity, a safe approach is to try both. If the approaches approximately agree,
default to standard ANOVA.
