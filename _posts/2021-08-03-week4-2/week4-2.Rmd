1. In random effects models, there are three key parameters: $\mu,
\sigma^2_{\tau}, \sigma^2$. Two ways to fit them are (1) the method of moments
and (2) maximum likelihood. The different approaches to estimation have
different properties, so even though knowing the intricate details of the
computation is not necessary, having a basic understanding of how the approaches
work can help make sure we use appropriate software implementations.

### Method of Moments

2. For estimating $\mu$, this method uses the overall mean $\bar{y}$.

3. What about the $\sigma^2$’s? The key identity is,
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{E}\left[MS_{\text{treatments}}\right] &= \sigma^2 + n \sigma_{\tau}^2 \\
\mathbf{E}\left[MS_{E}\right] &= \sigma^2
\end{align*}

4. We can approximate the expected values using,
\begin{align*}
MS_{\text{treatment}} \approx \sigma^2 + n \sigma_{\tau}^2 \\
MS_{E} \approx \sigma^2
\end{align*}

5. If we pretended these approximations were exact equalities, then we have two
equations with two unknowns. The method of moments defines parameter estimates
as the solutions to that system of equations.
\begin{align}
\hat{\sigma}^2 &= MS_{E} \\
\hat{\sigma}^2_{\tau} &= \frac{1}{n}\left[MS_{\text{treatments}} - MS_{E}\right]
\end{align}

6. How can we get confidence intervals for these estimates?
    * For $\hat{\mu} = \bar{y}$, we can use $\text{Var}\left(y\right) = \frac{1}{N} \text{Var}\left(y_{ij}\right)=\frac{1}{N}\left(\sigma^2 + n\sigma^2_{\tau}\right)$
    * For $\hat{\sigma}^2$, we can use the fact that $\frac{N - a}{\sigma^2}MS_{E} \sim \chi^2_{N - a}$.
    * For $\hat{\sigma}^2_{\tau}$, we’re out of luck, though some papers give
    approximate confidence intervals.

### Maximum Likelihood Estimation

7. An alternative approach is to use maximum likelihood. The first step is to
stack all the $y_{ij}$’s into one long length $N$ vector, and observe that the
data are jointly normally distributed,
$$
\left(\begin{array}{c}
y_{11} \\
y_{12} \\
\vdots \\
y_{a(n-1)} \\
y_{a n}
\end{array}\right) \sim \mathcal{N}\left(\mu 1_{N},\left(\begin{array}{cccc}
\sigma^{2} I_{n}+\sigma_{\tau}^{2} 1_{n} 1_{n}^{T} & \mathbf{0} & \ldots & \mathbf{0} \\
\mathbf{0} & \sigma^{2} I_{n}+\sigma_{\tau}^{2} 1_{n} 1_{n}^{T} & \ldots & \mathbf{0} \\
\vdots & \vdots & & \vdots \\
\mathbf{0} & \mathbf{0} & \ldots & \sigma^{2} I_{n}+\sigma_{\tau}^{2} 1_{n} 1_{n}^{T}
\end{array}\right)\right)
$$
  Here, $1_{n}$ refers to a vector of $n$ 1's stacked in a column and $I_{n}$
  refers to the $n\times n$ identity matrix.

```


8. The specific form of the covariance isn’t important. What is important is
that we can exactly evaluate the probability of $y_{11}, y_{12},\dots, y_{an}$ under
any choice of the parameters $\mu, \sigma^2, \sigma^2_{\tau}$.

9. Define $L(\mu, \sigma^2, \sigma^2_{\tau})$ to be the probability of the
dataset $y_{11}, y_{12}, \dots y_{an}$ viewed as a function of the normal
distribution’s parameters. A good estimate for these parameters comes from
finding the configuration that maximizes $L\left(\mu, \sigma^2,
\sigma^2_{\tau}\right)$. The maximizers can’t be found analytically, but
algorithms exist to find the maximizers.

```

10. Software also gives a confidence interval for the estimates. It works by
studying the curvature of the likelihood function at the maximizer.

```{r, fig.cap = "A highly peaked likelihood surface will give a smaller confidence interval, because there is a smaller set parameters that gives a good probability to the observed data."}

```

### Code Implementation

11. Which method should we use in practice? There are a few considerations,
  * If confidence intervals are necessary for more than just $\hat{\mu}$ and
  $\hat{\sigma}^2$, then maximum likelihood should be used.
  * It can turn out that the method of moments returns negative values for
  $\hat{\sigma}^2$. It is solving an algebraic equation and has no prior
  knowledge that variances should always be positive. If a negative variance is
  likely to be problematic, then maximum likelihood should be used.
  * Maximum likelihood is slow, because it requires an iterative
  optimization. The method of moments only requires the solution to a system of
  equations, though, and so is very fast. It is often the method of choice in
  large scale problems.
  
12. The `lme4` package implements the maximum likelihood approach to random
effects model estimation; this package is reviewed in the previous notes.

13. To estimate the method of moments, we can do all the calculations by hand --
we just need the results from an ANOVA table.

```{r, echo = TRUE}
library(readr)
library(broom)
loom <- read_csv("https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/ezp3i2pflhi96si7u6rfn3dg3lb5cl3z.csv")
loom$loom <- as.factor(loom$loom)
N <- nrow(loom)
a <- nlevels(loom$loom)
n <- N / a

aov_table <- aov(lm(strength ~ loom, data = loom)) %>%
  tidy()
```

14. The code below computes point estimates for $\sigma^2$ and $\sigma_{\tau}^2$
based on the formulas above, using the `MSE` quantities available in the ANOVA
table. It also computes the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), which is
defined in the reading.

```{r, echo = TRUE}
sigma_sqs = vector(length = 2)
sigma_sqs[1] <- aov_table$meansq[2] # estimate for sigma^2
sigma_sqs[2] <- (aov_table$meansq[1] - aov_table$meansq[2]) / n # estimate for sigma^2_tau

sigma_sqs
sigma_sqs[2] / sum(sigma_sqs) # ICC
```

15. We can also use the formulas above to compute confidence intervals for
$\hat{\sigma}^2$. We use a formula from the book to build an analogous interval
for the ICC.

```{r, echo = TRUE}
int_bounds <- c(0.975, 0.025)
(N - a) * sigma_sqs[1] / qchisq(int_bounds, N - a) # CI for sigma^2

ratio_bounds <- 1 / n * (aov_table$statistic[1] / qf(int_bounds, a - 1, N - a) - 1)
ratio_bounds / (1 + ratio_bounds) # CI for ICC
```
