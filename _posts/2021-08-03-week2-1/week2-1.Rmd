Probability
The most basic idea of statistics is that if you ran an experiment again, you would get different results
i.e., there is randomness
Probability is the calculus of randomness

Definitions

The mean of a random variable Y defined as

```{r}

```

```{r}

```


```{r}

```

If there are just two values with equal probability, it’s just a midpoint
If one of the probability weights is larger, it’s closer to the larger weight
If you have many values, it’s closer to the ones with large weight
Think of continuous integral like Riemann sum in calculus

The variance of a random variable Y is defined as



Measures the amount of spread of Y around its mean


Useful properties

For calculations, it’s often easier to use properties of mean and variance to reduce to simpler expressions, rather than using the formulas above
Expectation is a linear function,

```


Variance is not linear, but satisfies,



	where we define the covariance as,



Sampling and Estimators

Goal: Draw inferences from the specific to the general.

Using a sample, estimate something about the population
Use a statistic (function of the data) to say something about the probability distribution it was drawn from

Two very useful statistics are the sample mean,

```{r}
include_graphics("https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/o3li54yw6986aurviiljfmgmrmuh5wms.png")
```

```{r}
include_graphics("https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/310ij7e4ki9xnn4doe191hks8k6h3o9z.png")
```

and the sample standard deviation,




Desirable properties

You want your statistics to be “unbiased” and “minimum variance”
Unbiased means it’s centered around the correct value, on average
Minimum variance means it’s not too far from the correct value, on average

Central limit theorem

For very many distributions, an appropriately rescaled version of the sample mean converges to a normal distribution
