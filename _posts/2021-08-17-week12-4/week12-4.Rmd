1. We have been fitting surfaces to find some configuration of factors that
optimizes a response. Sometimes we found the optimum just from one experiment,
but more often, we ran a series of experiments, gradually refining our
understanding of the response surface.

2. *For any of these experiments, what designs should we use?* In theory, any of
the designs we have discussed in this course could be used, but we will prefer
those which give us an accurate estimate of the response surface (especially
around stationary points) using as few samples as possible.

### Designs for First-Order Models

3. In first-order models, we are interested in linear effects associated with
each factor. Reasonable choices in this setting are,
  * $2^{K}$ factorial designs
  * $2^{K - p}$ fractional factorial designs
  * $2^{K}$ and $2^{K - p}$ designs that have been augmented with center points.
  These center points allow estimation of measurement error $\sigma^2$ even when
  there is no replication.

### Designs for Second-Order Models

4. For second-order models, we need to estimation nonlinear and interaction
effects, which means we need more intensive sampling. The most common choice is
the,
  * Central Composite Design (CCD): As discussed in Section 6.8, this is a full
  factorial $2^{K}$ design that has been supplemented by center and axial
  points.

  though some alternatives are,
  * Box-Behnken design: The associated samples are all on edges of the cube (none
  at vertices or in the interior).
  * Equiradial design: This generalizes the simplex idea above. Instead of
  sampling at the corners of an equilateral triangle, we can sample at corners of
  regular polygons (+ center points)

5. In practice, you can use functions from the `rsm` package. This code produces
a central composite design with three center points for both the factorial and
axial runs. The package also has code for factorial, fractional factorial, and
Box-Behnken designs.

```{r}
opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
library(rsm)

# code the time and temperature variables
codings <- list(
  time_coded ~ (time - 35) / 5,
  temp_coded ~ (temp - 150) / 5
)
ccd_design <- ccd(~ time_coded + temp_coded, coding = codings, oneblock = TRUE)
head(ccd_design)
```

```{r, fig.cap = "A generated CCD using the `rsm` package."}
ggplot(decode.data(ccd_design)) +
  geom_point(
    aes(time, temp),
    position = position_jitter(w = 0.5, h = 0.5),
    size = 3
  ) +
  coord_fixed()
```

6. Using the same function, we can easily generate fractional or foldover
designs, which are useful during the first-order phase of response surface
modeling. For example, the code below generates a $2^{4 - 1}$ design.

```{r, echo = TRUE}
codings_x = list(
  x1 ~ (x1_ - 10) / 3,
  x2 ~ (x2_ - 20) / 6,
  x3 ~ (x3_ + 1) / 4
)

ffactorial <- cube(
  ~ x1 + x2 + x3, 
  n0 = 0, 
  coding = codings_x,
  generators = x4 ~ x1 * x2 * x3
  )
```

7. And if we want to foldover this fractional factorial, we can use `foldover`.

```{r, echo = TRUE, results = "hide"}
foldover(ffactorial, randomize = FALSE)
```

```{r, fig.cap = "A $2^{4 - 1}$ fractional factorial design, made using the `rsm` package.", echo = FALSE}
mfactorial <- ffactorial %>%
  head() %>%
  melt(id.vars = "std.order") %>%
  filter(variable != "run.order")
ggplot(mfactorial) +
  geom_tile(
    aes(x = variable, y = as.factor(std.order), fill = as.factor(value))
  ) +
  coord_fixed() +
  labs(x = "factor", y = "run", fill = "level") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set2")
```

```{r, fig.cap = "The foldover of the previous fractional factorial design."}
mfactorial <- foldover(ffactorial, randomize=FALSE) %>%
  head() %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  pivot_longer(starts_with("x"))

ggplot(mfactorial) +
  geom_tile(
    aes(name, as.factor(std.order), fill = as.factor(value))
  ) +
  coord_fixed() +
  labs(x = "factor", y = "run", fill = "level") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set2")
```

### Variance of Response Surfaces

8. At any point $x$, it’s possible to estimate the variance of the surface at
that point, denoted $V\left(\hat{y}\left(x\right)\right)$.
  * For any response surface, we can also imagine an accompanying variance
  surface.
  * Away from factor configurations that we’ve sampled, we expect the variance to increase.
  * Using the `rsm` package, we can visualize these variance functions using the
  function `varfcn`.

9. If there are only 2 factors, this surface can be directly visualized. 
  * But in higher-dimensions, this is impossible.
  * In that case, use a _variance dispersion graph_ to visualize the variance as a function of the distance from the center point of the design.
  	* Specifically, plot the maximum, minimum, and average variances along rings that emanate from 0
  * If the variances are constant along each ring, the design is called _rotatable_

```{r, fig.margin = FALSE, fig.fullwidth = TRUE, fig.height = 5, fig.width = 10, echo = TRUE, fig.cap = "The scaled prediction variance functions for a rotatable CCD."}
ccd_design <- ccd(~ time_coded + temp_coded, coding = codings, oneblock = TRUE)
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
varfcn(ccd_design, ~ SO(time_coded, temp_coded))
varfcn(ccd_design, ~ SO(time_coded, temp_coded), contour = TRUE, asp = 1)
```

```{r, fig.margin = FALSE, fig.fullwidth = TRUE, fig.height = 5, fig.width = 10, fig.cap = "The analogous functions for a nonrotatable CCD. Note that the axis and diagonal variance curves don't overlap."}
ccd_design <- ccd(~ time_coded + temp_coded, coding = codings, alpha=2, oneblock = TRUE)
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
varfcn(ccd_design, ~ SO(time_coded, temp_coded))
varfcn(ccd_design, ~ SO(time_coded, temp_coded), contour = TRUE, asp = 1)
```
