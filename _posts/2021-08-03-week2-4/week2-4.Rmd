The reference distribution depends on three assumptions,
* Samples are independent. If they aren’t, then we’re pretending we have more samples than we do
* The standard deviations are equal
* The populations are normally distributed

```

For the last two, you can use something called a normal probability plot. This plots the sample quantiles against the theoretical normal distribution quantiles.
Power Analysis
People will often call you asking about what a good sample size is for their experiment. A good way to answer this is to compute the power curves as a function of different signal strengths.

```{r}

```

Of course, you can never know the signal strength in advance. But you can test a few different plausible ranges, based on past experience.
Important Variations
What if the variances are not equal?

Our test statistic used a pooled standard deviation. If the variances aren’t equal, we standardize differently,



This is unfortunately not exactly t-distributed under the null. That said, the reference distribution can be well approximated by one, and almost any statistical package will let you compute corresponding p-values and confidence intervals.

What if the variances are known?

In this case, don’t use S1 and S2 -- standardize using the known standard deviations. Since there’s no additional randomness coming from this estimation, the reference distribution is actually standard normal.
