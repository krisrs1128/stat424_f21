1. The reference distribution depends on three assumptions,
* Samples are independent. If they aren’t, then we’re pretending we have more
samples than we actually do.
* The standard deviations are equal.
* The populations are normally distributed.

```{r}
library(EBImage)
display(readImage("https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/n1a3bdzspet06ibsd1yebc1r6w7kzf3o.png"))
```

```{r}
include_graphics("https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/uzh72egfwwp251xzac932cej6kna1woz.png")
```

2. We can check the last two assumptions using something called a _normal
probability plot_. This plots the sample quantiles against the theoretical normal
distribution's quantiles.

### Power Analysis

3. People will often call you asking about what a good sample size is for their
experiment. A good way to answer this is to compute the power curves as a
function of different signal strengths.

```{r}
include_graphics("https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/06qu4t1q6jemmwto01vgd95jtzd0if3e.png")
```

4. Of course, we can never know the signal strength in advance. But we can test
a few different plausible ranges, based on past experience.

### Important Variations

5. __What if the variances are not equal?__
Our test statistic used a pooled standard deviation. If the variances aren’t
equal, we could standardize differently,

$$
\frac{\bar{y}_1 - \bar{y}_2}{\sqrt{\frac{S_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{S_2^2}{n_2}}}.
$$

6. This is unfortunately not exactly $t$-distributed under the null. That said,
the reference distribution can be well approximated by one, and almost any
statistical package will let you compute corresponding $p$-values and confidence
intervals.

7. _What if the variances are known?_ In this case, we can avoid using $S_1$ and
$S_2$. Instead, we ought to standardize using the known standard deviations.
Since there’s no additional randomness coming from estimation, the reference
distribution is a standard normal, not a $t$-distribution.
