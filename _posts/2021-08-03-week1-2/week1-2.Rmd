Example [Golf]
You can imagine someone’s golf score being a function of many factors,

```
golf score = f(driver type, type of ball, …)
```
When you only study two factors at a time, each with two possible values, this is called a 22 design
You can visualize the 4 possible configurations as corners of a square
The golf score is the height of the plane.

```

Mathematically,

Interactions

It’s possible that the effect of one factor depends on the value of the other. We say the two factors interact with one another.
In this case, the slopes along the edges are no longer parallel.
The previous formula doesn’t capture this. Instead, we need,


because now the slopes can change depending on the value of the other factor,

```

Replicates

For each configuration of factors, it is better to play several rounds of golf
If you played many rounds, you’d eventually have a good estimate of the effects from each factor

More than 2 factors
Suppose we want to see how K different binary factors influence golf score
We can no longer visualize the effects as corners of a square
But we can still collect samples for each configuration of factors. This is called a 2K experiment
A challenge is that for large K, this means collecting lots of samples
K = 3 means 8 configurations
K = 4 means 16
etc.

Example [Soldering]

Experimental design is often used in characterizing a process
How do each of the knobs affect the outcome?
Sometimes we ask whether certain knobs matter at all. This is called factor screening.

```

Example [Chemical Process Yield]

Sometimes we want to optimize a process across several continuous variables
Visualize the value to optimize as a smooth function of the factors
Make a preliminary test, and proceed in the direction of the max
This is called the response surface method
