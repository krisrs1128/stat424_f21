### Multiple Comparisons

1. As before, we may want to use contrasts to decide on which treatment effects
are different We can continue to use the same multiple comparisons procedures as
before, but have to account for a few differences,
  * The number of samples per treatment $n$ is replaced by the number of blocks $b$.
  * The d.f. for $MS_{E}$ is now $(a - 1)(b - 1)$, not $N - a$.
  
2. For example, the cutoff in Fisher’s LSD becomes
$$
t_{\frac{\alpha}{2}, \left(a - 1\right)\left(b - 1\right)}\sqrt{\frac{2 MS_{E}}{b}}
$$

### Model Diagnostics

3. There are two key assumptions when we use RCBDs,
  * $\epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}\left(0, \sigma^2\right)$ are independently
  distributed. Note that this also implies homoskedasticity (the variances are
  not changing from sample to sample).
  * Additivity (i.e. "no interaction"). The treatment effects $\tau_i$ need to
  be the same across all blocks.

4. We’ve seen the first assumption before, and can continue to use normal
probability plots and residual analysis to check it.

5. One way to check additivity is to look at residuals, and see whether they are
consistently lower / higher in some blocks.

6. What can we do if we find an interaction effect?
  * Sometimes the interaction effects will disappear after transforming the response (e.g., using $\log$ or $\sqrt$)
  * Otherwise, another design may be necessary. Factorial designs (to be
  discussed soon) allow for inference even in the presence of interactions.
