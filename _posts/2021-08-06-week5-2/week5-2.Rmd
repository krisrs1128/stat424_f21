### Multiple Comparisons

1. As before, we may want to use contrasts to decide on which treatment effects
are different We can continue to use the same multiple comparisons procedures as
before, but have to account for a few differences,
    * The number of samples per treatment $n$ is replaced by the number of blocks $b$.
    * The d.f. for $MS_{E}$ is now $(a - 1)(b - 1)$, not $N - a$.

```{r, out.width = 350}
include_graphics("https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/qezu75a0hv1qhqyeoz8wb7sbb294vrsm.png")
```
  
2. For example, the cutoff in Fisher’s LSD becomes
$$
t_{\frac{\alpha}{2}, \left(a - 1\right)\left(b - 1\right)}\sqrt{\frac{2 MS_{E}}{b}}
$$

### Model Diagnostics

3. There are two key assumptions when we use RCBDs,
    * $\epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}\left(0, \sigma^2\right)$ are independently
    distributed. Note that this also implies homoskedasticity (the variances are
    not changing from sample to sample).
    * Additivity (i.e. "no interaction"). The treatment effects $\tau_i$ need to
    be the same across all blocks.
    
```{r, preview = TRUE, fig.cap = "An example where the additivity assumption fails.", out.width = 350}
include_graphics("https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/dmob9sjh8my7l8hez390o7gnn3vu1oe6.png")
```

4. We’ve seen the first assumption before, and can continue to use normal
probability plots and residual analysis to check it.

5. One way to check additivity is to look at residuals, and see whether they are
consistently lower / higher in some blocks.

6. What can we do if we find an interaction effect?
    * Sometimes the interaction effects will disappear after transforming the response (e.g., using $\log$ or $\sqrt{}$)
    * Otherwise, another design may be necessary. Factorial designs (to be
    discussed soon) allow for inference even in the presence of interactions.
    
### Code Example

7. We will continue the graft example from the previous notes. First, let's
refit the RCBD model.

```{r}
opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
library(readr)
library(tidyr)
graft <- read_table2("https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/0ciblk4z2f3k6zizbj4plg3q33w1d0n6.txt") %>%
  pivot_longer(-Pressure, names_to = "batch", values_to = "yield")
graft$Pressure <- as.factor(graft$Pressure)
fit <- lm(yield ~ Pressure + batch, graft)
aov_table <- aov(fit)
```

8. We can fit contrasts and correct for multiple comparisons using the same type
of code as for ANOVA without batch effects.

```{r}
library(gmodels)
library(DescTools)

contrasts <- matrix(
  c(1, 1, -1, -1,
    1, 0, 0, -1),
  nrow = 2, byrow=TRUE
)

fit.contrast(aov_table, "Pressure", contrasts)
PostHocTest(aov_table, method = "scheffe", contrasts = contrasts)
TukeyHSD(aov_table)
```

9. To check the normality and additivity assumptions, we can plot the residuals
against the batch. Even though additivity doesn't seem to be a problem (no group
of residuals is consistently $> 0$ or $< 0$), equality of variance across
batches seems to be violated. The variance of Batch 6's residuals is too small.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
graft$residual <- resid(fit)
ggplot(graft) +
  geom_point(aes(x = batch, y = residual, col = Pressure)) +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set2")
```
