Multiple Comparisons

As before, we may want to use contrasts to decide on which treatment effects are different 
We can continue to use the same multiple comparisons procedures as before
Only differences:
The number of samples per treatment n is replaced by the number of blocks b.
The df for MSE is now (a - 1)(b - 1), not N - a.
For example, the cutoff in Fisher’s LSD becomes


Model Diagnostics

There are two key assumptions,
ijN(0, 2) are independently distributed. Note that this also implies homoskedasticity (the variances are not changing from sample to sample).
Additivity (i.e. “no interaction”). The treatment effect i needs to be the same across all blocks.

We’ve seen the first assumption before, and can continue to use normal probability plots and residual analysis to check it.



One way to check additivity is to look at residuals, and see whether they are consistently lower / higher in some blocks.

What can we do if we find an interaction effect?
Sometimes it’s enough to transform the response
Otherwise, another design may be necessary. Factorial designs (to be discussed soon) allow for inference even in the presence of interactions.
