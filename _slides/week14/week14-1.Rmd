### Statistical Experimental Design

### Learning Strategies

I hope some of the learning strategies we've used in this course help you in
your future studies.

* Complex notation can often be summarized by pictures
* Concrete examples are useful reference points
* Simulation experiments can help deepen understanding
* Being able to implement a method, however simple, is worth much more than just
knowing about a method, however sophisticated

---

### Today

* No technical material
* Some thoughts on practical statistics

---

# Problem Discovery

---

### Story 1

* During World War II, a team of statisticians was asked about where to put
armor on airplanes.
* They were given data about where bullet holes were found on returning aircraft

Where should they put the armor?

Where should they put the armor?

Wherever bullet holes were not found...

### Reflection

* It's critical to know where the data came from
  - Almost every practicing statistician will have stories
* The problem that's easiest to solve might not be the one that's most relevant

---

# Explore Problem Structure

---

### ANOVA and Agriculture

* The first application of ANOVA was to agricultural field trials (~ 1920)
* Which variety of crops provide the most yield?
* Blocking needed because of field-to-field variation

```

---

### Sequential Design and Industrial Processes

* First application of response surfaces was to industrial and manufacturing
processes (~ 1960)
* Optimization needed to find ideal operating conditions
* Unlike agriculture, could gather samples in rapid succession
  - Led to sequential view

### Randomization and Online Networks

* A social network wants to see whether special notifications encourage people to send messages to their friends
* Two groups: Those who see the notification (treatment) and those who don't (control)
  - But what if someone in treatment messages someone in control?
  - Both have increased messaging activity

---

### Randomization and Online Networks

One solution is to assign treatment / control to separate subnetworks, but this
problem is still open

```{r}
include_graphics("cluster-randomize.png")
```

---

### Reflection

* The methods we use in statistics are shaped by the context within which they were developed
* Constraints that were true in the past may no longer hold
* Carefully examining problem structure can lead to improved methods

---

# Asking Better Questions

---

### Why analyze data?

* Good data analysis sparks the formulation of better questions
  - Finding an "answer" is secondary
* Sharper questions helps inform decisions, either by adding to our body of
beliefs or bringing uncertainties into focus
