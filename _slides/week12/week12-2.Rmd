### Motivation

* **Multiple Responses** Usually, we need to balance several competing objectives. 
  - Process efficiency vs. cost, material strength vs. production speed, ...
  - How can response surfaces be adapted to this multi-response setup?
* **Designs** We have a choice of designs during both the first and second order phases
  - Which designs are most commonly used, and why?

---

### Comparing Contours

The most straightforward approach is to treat each response separately.
* We can compare contours to find acceptable configurations
* Below: Response surfaces for yield, viscosity, and molecular weight

```{r, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 3, out.width = 920, dpi = 200}
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(rsm)

chem <- read_csv("https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/nbaj1m8j7tuaqmznjlrsgbzyhp9k61i8.csv")
chem_coded <- coded.data(chem, time_coded ~ (time - 35) / 5, temp_coded ~ (temp - 155) / 5)
fits <- list(
  "yield" = rsm(yield ~ SO(temp_coded, time_coded), data = chem_coded),
  "viscosity" = rsm(viscosity ~ SO(temp_coded, time_coded), data = chem_coded),
  "molecular_weight" = rsm(molecular_weight ~ SO(temp_coded, time_coded), data = chem_coded)
)
par(mfrow = c(1, 3))
contour(fits[[1]], ~ time_coded + temp_coded, image = TRUE, asp = 1)
contour(fits[[2]], ~ time_coded + temp_coded, image = TRUE, asp = 1)
contour(fits[[3]], ~ time_coded + temp_coded, image = TRUE, asp = 1)
par(mfrow = c(1, 1))
```

---

### Constrained Optimization

* Define acceptable ranges for responses  $y_{2}\left(x\right), \dots, y_{R}\left(x\right)$ that are important, but not our main focus.
* Optimize the response $y_{1}\left(x\right)$ thatâ€™s our main focus.

```{r, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 3, out.width = 920, dpi = 200}
par(mfrow = c(1, 3))
contour(fits[[1]], ~ time_coded + temp_coded, image = TRUE, asp = 1)
contour(fits[[2]], ~ time_coded + temp_coded, image = TRUE, asp = 1)
contour(fits[[3]], ~ time_coded + temp_coded, image = TRUE, asp = 1)
par(mfrow = c(1, 1))
```

---

### Constrained Optimization

Formally, this seeks the $x_{\ast}$ that solves,
\begin{align*}
\underset{x}{\text{maximize}}\space &y_{1}\left(x\right) \\
\text{subject to }\space &\left(y_{2}\left(x\right), \dots, y_{R}\left(x\right)\right) \in \mathcal{C}
\end{align*}
where $\mathcal{C}$ is a preset constraint region.
```{r, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 3, out.width = 800, dpi = 200}
par(mfrow = c(1, 3))
contour(fits[[1]], ~ time_coded + temp_coded, image = TRUE, asp = 1)
contour(fits[[2]], ~ time_coded + temp_coded, image = TRUE, asp = 1)
contour(fits[[3]], ~ time_coded + temp_coded, image = TRUE, asp = 1)
par(mfrow = c(1, 1))
```

---

### Desirability Functions

* A difficulty with the constrained optimization approach is that it forces us
to prioritize one response over the rest
* We can instead optimize the product,
\begin{align*}
\underset{x}{\text{maximize}} \space \left[\prod_{r = 1}^{R} d_{r}\left(y_{r}\left(x\right)\right)\right]^{\frac{1}{R}}
\end{align*}
for some _desirability_ functions $d_r \in \left[0, 1\right]$ that take high
values when $y_r$ is in a desirable region.
* The product will only be high when all the $y_r$ are in desirable regions

### Desirability Functions

Example functions $d_r$, 

```{r, fig.height = 3, fig.width = 6, out.width = 800}
library(stringr)
library(desirability)
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)

x_grid <- seq(-1, 1, .01)
example_funs <- data.frame(
  x = x_grid,
  d_max_0.5 = predict(dMax(0, 1, 0.5),  x_grid),
  d_max_1 = predict(dMax(0, 1, 1),  x_grid),
  d_max_2 = predict(dMax(0, 1, 2), x_grid),
  d_min_0.5 = predict(dMin(-1, 0, 0.5), x_grid),
  d_min_1 = predict(dMin(-1, 0, 1), x_grid),
  d_min_2 = predict(dMin(-1, 0, 2), x_grid),
  d_target_0.5 = predict(dTarget(-1, 0, 1, 0.5, 0.5), x_grid),
  d_target_1 = predict(dTarget(-1, 0, 1), x_grid),
  d_target_2 = predict(dTarget(-1, 0, 1, 2, 2), x_grid)
) %>%
  pivot_longer(-x, names_to="fun") %>%
  mutate(
    type = str_replace(fun, "[\\.0-9]+", ""),
    scale = str_extract(fun, "[\\.0-9]+")
  )

ggplot(example_funs) +
  geom_line(aes(x, value, col = scale)) +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set2") +
  facet_grid(.~ type)
```

### Designs for Response Surfaces

* Sometimes we found the optimum just from one experiment, but more often, we
ran a series of experiments, gradually refining our understanding of the
response surface.
* At each step, which design should we use?

### Designs for First-Order Models

.pull-left[
* First first order models, we are interested in linear effects associated with
each factor.
* We can be more sample efficient in this phase
]

.pull-right[
  * $2^{K}$ factorial designs
  * $2^{K - p}$ fractional factorial designs
  * $2^{K}$ and $2^{K - p}$ designs that have been augmented with center points.
]

---

### Designs for Second-Order Models

For second-order models, we need to estimation nonlinear and interaction
effects, which requires more intensive sampling.

.pull-left[
* **Central Composite Design (CCD)**: This is a full factorial $2^{K}$ design that
has been supplemented by center and axial points.
* Equiradial design: This samples sample at the corners of regular polygons (+
center points)
]

.pull-right[
```{r, fig.width = 4, fig.height = 4, out.width = 400}
codings <- list(
  time_coded ~ (time - 35) / 5,
  temp_coded ~ (temp - 150) / 5
)
ccd_design <- ccd(~ time_coded + temp_coded, coding = codings, oneblock = TRUE, alpha = 3)

ggplot(data.frame(ccd_design)) +
  geom_point(aes(time_coded, temp_coded)) +
  coord_fixed()
```

# Code Implementation

### Chemical Process dataset

In this dataset, we want to maximize yield while maintaining a target viscosity
and minimizing molecular weight.

```{r, echo = TRUE}
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(rsm)
chem <- read_csv("https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/nbaj1m8j7tuaqmznjlrsgbzyhp9k61i8.csv")
head(chem, 4)
```

---

### Comparing Contours

For this approach, we can use the same code as before, but fitting a separate
model for each response.

```{r, echo = TRUE}
chem_coded <- coded.data(chem, time_coded ~ (time - 35) / 5, temp_coded ~ (temp - 155) / 5)
fits <- list(
  "yield" = rsm(yield ~ SO(temp_coded, time_coded), data = chem_coded),
  "viscosity" = rsm(viscosity ~ SO(temp_coded, time_coded), data = chem_coded),
  "molecular_weight" = rsm(molecular_weight ~ SO(temp_coded, time_coded), data = chem_coded)
)
```

---

### Comparing Contours

```{r}
```

```{r, echo = TRUE, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 3, out.width = 920, dpi = 200}
par(mfrow = c(1, 3))
contour(fits[[1]], ~ time_coded + temp_coded, image = TRUE, asp = 1)
contour(fits[[2]], ~ time_coded + temp_coded, image = TRUE, asp = 1)
contour(fits[[3]], ~ time_coded + temp_coded, image = TRUE, asp = 1)
```

---

### Desirability Functions

For the desirability approach, we can define desirability functions using
`dMax`, `dTarget`, and `dMin`. The arguments specify where desirability should
be highest.

```{r, echo = TRUE, fig.height = 3.2, fig.width = 6, out.width = 500}
library(desirability)
d_yield <- dMax(70, 95) # min / max / scale
plot(d_yield)
```

---

### Desirability Functions

For the desirability approach, we can define desirability functions using
`dMax`, `dTarget`, and `dMin`. The arguments specify where desirability should
be highest.

```{r, echo = TRUE, fig.height = 3.2, fig.width = 6, out.width = 500}
d_viscosity <- dTarget(55, 65, 75) # min / target / max
plot(d_viscosity)
```

---

### Desirability Functions

For the desirability approach, we can define desirability functions using
`dMax`, `dTarget`, and `dMin`. The arguments specify where desirability should
be highest.

```{r, echo = TRUE, fig.height = 3.2, fig.width = 6, out.width = 500}
d_weight <- dMin(2750, 4000) # min / max
plot(d_weight)
```

---

### Desirability Functions

* Once we have each $d_r$, we can use `dOverall` to combine them.
This function will be large only if all its arguments are.
* We can then evaluate this objective over a grid of time and temperature values.

```{r, echo = TRUE}
objective <- dOverall(d_yield, d_viscosity, d_weight)
coded <- as.data.frame(chem_coded)
x_grid <- expand.grid(
  time_coded = seq(min(coded$time_coded), max(coded$time_coded), .1),
  temp_coded = seq(min(coded$temp_coded), max(coded$temp_coded), 0.1)
)
head(x_grid)
```

---

### Desirability Functions

* The code on the right finds $\hat{y}_{r}\left(x\right)$ for each response $r$,
across the full grid of $x$ values defined on the previous slide.
* For each configuration of $\hat{y}_r\left(x\right)$, we can compute a
desirability value.

```{r, echo = TRUE}
library(purrr)
y_hat <- map_dfc(fits, ~ predict(., x_grid))
x_grid$objective <- predict(objective, y_hat)
head(x_grid)
```

---

### Desirability Functions

We can then visualize the desirability of each factor combination.

```{r, fig.margin = FALSE, echo = TRUE, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 5.5, out.width = 400}
ggplot(x_grid) +
  geom_tile(aes(time_coded, temp_coded, fill = objective, col = objective)) +
  coord_fixed() +
  scale_fill_viridis_c() +
  scale_color_viridis_c()
```

---

### Designs

The `rsm` package comes with functions for specifying designs.
- `cube` for factorial designs
- `n0` $\to$ number of center points
- `reps` $\to$ number of replicates

```{r}
codings <- list(time_coded ~ (time - 35) / 5, temp_coded ~ (temp - 150) / 5)
cube(~ time_coded + temp_coded, coding = codings, n0 = 0, reps = 2)
```

### Exercise

This walks through problem 11.27 in the textbook.

An article describes using a central composite design to improve the packaging
of one-pound coffee. The objective is to produce an airtight seal that is easy
to open without damaging the top of the coffee bag. The experimenters studied
three factors -- $x_1 = $ plastic viscosity (300 - 400 centipoise), $x_{2} = $
clamp pressure (170 - 190 psi), and $x_{3} = $plate gap (-3, +3 mm) and two
responses, $y_1 = $ tear and $y_2 = $ leakage. The tear response was measured on
a scale of 0 - 9 (good to bad) and leakage was proportion failing. Each run used
a sample of 20 bags for response measurement.

(a) Build a second-order model for the tear response

(b) Build a second-order model for the leakage response.

(c) Analyze residuals for both models. Are transformations necessary?

(d) Construct contour plots for both responses.  What conditions would you
recommend for process operation to minimize leakage and keep tear below 0.75?
