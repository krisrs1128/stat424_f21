### Plan

.pull-left[
Main Content,
* Setting up R
* Data structures
* Control flow
* Functions
]

.pull-right[
Optional Topics,
* General Q&A
* Debugging
* Code Style
]

---

### Setting up R

.pull-left[
* R: A programming language designed for statistical computing
* Rstudio: A programming environment that makes it easy to write R code
]

.pull-right[
* Installation: [R](https://www.r-project.org/), [Rstudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)

* Windows: Also install [rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/)
]
---

### Rmarkdown

Rmarkdown makes it convenient to write reports that use R code outputs.

* To create a new file in Rstudio, click the green + and select new "R Notebook"
* To create a new code block, select Code -> New Chunk (shortcut `Ctrl + Alt + i`)
* To compile a document, press the "Knit" button along the top of the screen (or, `Shift + Cmd + K`)
* Always save your code!!

---

# Data Structures

---

### Main Questions

R has built-in data structures called `vectors`, `matrices`, `lists`, and
`data.frames`. They are used for storing raw data as well as analysis results.

* How do we create them?
* How to access entries?
* How to modify them?

---

### Vectors

* Vectors are one-dimensional arrays where all the elements have the same data
type.
* They are a basic building block for more complex data structures
* They can be be created explicitly using the `c()` notation

```{r}
x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4)
y <- c("a", "b", "c", "d")
u <- vector(length = 5) # an empty vector of length 5
```

---

### Vectors

Many basic functions return vectors.

```{r}
z <- rnorm(4) # sample 4 random normal variables
v <- rep(1, 10) # repeat the entry 1, 10 times
```

---

### Access

We can access a vector's entries in two ways,

* A numeric vector of coordinates to extract
* A boolean vector with `TRUE`'s in the entries we want to extract

```{r}
x[1:3]
y[c(1, 4)]
y[c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE)]
```

---

### Access

The indices can themselves be stored as variables.

```{r}
indices <- c(1, 4)
y[indices]
```

---

### Modification

We can combine, difference, and apply functions to vectors.

```{r}
x1 <- c(1, 2, 3)
x2 <- c(4, 5, 6)
c(x1, x2) # concatenation
setdiff(x2, c(4, 7)) # differences
x1 ^ 2
sum(x1)
```

---

### Matrices

* Matrices are the two-dimensional analog of vectors.
* They are mainly used for linear algebraic operations.
* We will use them much less frequently in this class.

```{r}
matrix(c(1, 2, 3, 4), nrow = 2)
matrix(c(1, 2, 3, 4), nrow = 2, byrow = TRUE)
matrix(rnorm(4), nrow = 2)
diag(2)
```

---

### Matrices

* Matrix elements are indexed using both their row and column coordinates.
* Entire rows or columns can be extracted
* The results can be saved into new variables

```{r}
x <- matrix(rnorm(12), nrow = 4)
x
x[3, 1] # element at row 3, column 1
x[1, ] # get the first row
z <- x[, 3] # store the third column in a new variable
z
```

---

### Data Frames

Data Frames are analogous to matrices, except they allow several data types
(e.g., letters and numbers) in the same object.

```{r}
df <- data.frame(
  numbers = c(1, 2, 3),
  letters = c("A", "B", "C")
)

df
```

---

### Data Frames

* Elements can accessed either using `[row, column]` or `$column[row]` notation.
* The `$column` notation extracts the column `column` as a vector.

```{r}
df$numbers
df[, "numbers"]
df$numbers[1:2]
df[1:2, "numbers"]
# Q: how to get the entries "A" and "C"?
```

---

### Lists

* Lists are even more general than data.frames
* Elements in Data Frames can have arbitrary numbers of elements
* Arbitrary data types can be included in a single list

```{r}
x <- list(c(1, 2, 3), c(4, 5, 6, 7)) # collection of vectors
y <- list()
x
y
```

---

### Lists

* Lists are even more general than data.frames
* Elements in Data Frames can have arbitrary numbers of elements
* Arbitrary data types can be included in a single list

```{r}
y <- list(data.frame(A = rnorm(3)), data.frame(B = runif(5))) # collection of data.frames
y
```

---

### Lists

* To access the $i$ element of a list, use double brackets: `[[i]]`
* Once that element is extracted, refer to that element's data type to determine
further access

```{r}
x[[1]]
x[[1]][3] # element [[1]] is a vector
```

---

### Lists

* To access the $i$ element of a list, use double brackets: `[[i]]`
* Once that element is extracted, refer to that element's data type to determine
further access

```{r}
y[[1]]
y[[1]]$A[2] # element [[1]] is a data.frame with column "A"
```

---

# Control Flow

---

###

---

### `for` loops

```{r}
for (i in 1:3) {
  print("hello!")
}
```

---

### `for` loops

```{r}
x <- c(4, 3, 2, 1)
y <- vector(length = 3)
for (i in 1:3) {
  y[i] <- x[i + 1]
}

x
y
```

---

### Nested `for` loops

```{r}
x <- list()

counter <- 1
for (i in 1:4) {
  for (j in 1:5) {
    x[[counter]] <- c(i, j)
    counter <- counter + 1
  }
}

x
```


---

### `if` statements

```{r}
v <- TRUE
#v <- FALSE # what happens if we use this instead?
if (v) {
  print("hello!")
} else {
  print("goodbye!")
}
```

---

### Combining statements

```{r}
for (i in 1:10) {
  if (i < 5 || i > 8) {
    print(i)
  }
}
```

---

### Functions

```{r}
sum_of_squares <- function(x) {
  sum(x ^ 2)
}

sum_of_squares(c(1, 2, 3))
```

---

### Functions

```{r}
partial_sum_squares <- function(x, k = 3) {
  indices <- 1:k
  subset_x <- x[indices]
  sum_of_squares(subset_x)
}

partial_sum_squares(1:4)
partial_sum_squares(1:4, k = 4)
# Q: Is the subset_x variable accessible from here?
```

---

### Functions

```{r}
partial_sum_squares <- function(x, k = 3) {
  indices <- 1:k
  subset_x <- x[indices]
  list(subset = subset_x, sum = sum_of_squares(subset_x))
}

partial_sum_squares(1:5, 4)
```

---

### Debugging

* When debugging code, it's important to discover incorrect assumptions
* Are there data structures that are not formed in the way that you expected?
* `print()` statements can reveal information, but you can learn more using a formal debugger

---

### `browser()`

* `browser()` interrupts code so that you can inspect the environment just before a bug
* `n` continues to the next line
* `c` continues to the next `browser()` statement
* `Q` exits

```{r, echo = TRUE}
broken <- function() {
   x <- 1
   y <- "test"
   x + y
}
```

---

### `browser()`

* `browser()` interrupts code so that you can inspect the environment just before a bug
* `n` continues to the next line
* `c` continues to the next `browser()` statement
* `Q` exits

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
broken <- function() {
   x <- 1
   y <- "test"
   browser()
   u <- 100
   n <- 10
   browser()
   x + y
}

broken()
```

---

### Top-down Code Design

* The most readable code is modular
* If a step is not obvious, encapsulate it by its own function
   - Don't try writing both low and high-level code at the same time!
* If you are tempted to copy and paste, turn it into a function

```{r, echo = TRUE}
complex_task <- function() {
  setup_variables()
  main_algorithm()
  finalize_results()
}
```

---
### Concepts

* "Code is written for people, not computers"
* Style conventions help others read your code 
* Automatic style checkers can highlight stylistic issues in your code

---

### Style Checkers 

In R, you can use `lintr`.

```{r, echo = TRUE}
library(lintr)
lint("test.R")
```

You can also add plugins to many editors that highlight style issues as you
code.
