### Announcements

* Midterm 2 is material from Week 7 (Tuesday) to today, Week 11 (Tuesday)
* Exam is same format as Midterm 1, but with slightly fewer computation / more
conceptual questions
  * HW6 may help with conceptual parts
* There is an event from the Statistics Club today

> The Statistics Club is hosting Professor Deshpande from the Statistics Department, who will be giving a talk about his research and career journey! The event will be held today, Tuesday 11/16 at 6PM, SMI Room 133 (Ian’s Pizza will be served). We will also launch Spring 2022 Exec Board applications at this event. Contact ejkim23@wisc.edu with any questions about the club.

---

### Today

* Book Sections: 8.3 - 8.4
* Online Notes: Week 11 [1]

---

### Motivation

* $2^{K - 1}$ designs allow us to draw similar conclusions as $2^{K}$ designs
using only $\frac{1}{2}$ of the samples
* The approach can be generalized: A $2^{K - p}$ design allows us to use only
$\frac{1}{2^{p}}$ samples of the full design
  - E.g., $\frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{8}, \frac{1}{16}\dots$
* Goal: Be able to construct and analyze $2^{K - p}$ designs

---

### Recipe

1. Build a full factorial design from $K - p$ of the factors. The associated
full factorial is called the _basic design_.
2. Choose $p$ generators, which confound the remaining $p$ factors with terms
from the full factorial design.
3. Extend the table using the the relations in (2). This table specifies which
factors should be active in each run.

---

### Example

* Suppose we are interested in 6 factors, $A, \dots, F$.
* We will build a $2^{6 - 2}$ design
  - A $2^{6}$ design would require 64 samples
  - The $2^{6 - 2}$ design only requires 16 samples

---

### Step 1: Setup the Basic Design

.pull-left[
* We will choose the full factorial based on A, ..., D.
  - We could have used any subset of 4 factors
]

.pull-right[
| A | B | C	| D |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| - | - | - | - |
| + | - | - | - |
| - | + | - | - |
| - | - | + | - |
| - | - | - | + |

| + | + | + | - |
| + | + | - | + |
| + | - | + | + |
| - | + | + | + |
| + | + | + | + |
]

---

### Step 2: Choose Complete Defining Relations

* We will use $E = ABC$ and $F = BCD$, with the hope that aliasing $E$ and $F$
with high-order interactions will give high resolution.
* Definition: The _complete defining relations_ are the products of columns that
would give the all ones $I$ column.
  * This is useful for discussing a design with others, since there are many
  choices that have to be made while constructing $2^{K - p}$ designs
  * For this design, they are $ABCE = BCDF = ADEF = I$

---

### Step 3: Extending the Table

.pull-left[
Multiply across the generating relations to choose settings for E and F.
]

.pull-right[
| A | B | C	| D | E = ABC | F = BCD |

###  Alias Groups

Based on the complete defining relations, we can find all alias groups (multiply
by each factor). In practice, we can use code discussed below.

.pull-left[
\begin{align}
  I&=A B C E=B C D F=A D E F \\
  A&=B C E=D E F=A B C D F \\
  B&=A C E=C D F=A B D E F \\
  C&=A B E=B D F=A C D E F \\
  D&=B C F=A E F=A B C D E \\
  E&=A B C=A D F=B C D E F \\
  F&=B C D=A D E=A B C E F \\
  A B&=C E=A C D F=B D E F \\
\end{align}
]

.pull-right[
\begin{align}
  A C&=B E=A B D F=C D E F \\
  A D&=E F=B C D E=A B C F \\
  A E&=B C=D F=A B C D E F \\
  A F&=D E=B C E F=A B C D \\
  B D&=C F=A C D E=A B E F \\
  B F&=C D=A C E F=A B D E \\
  A C D&=B D E=A B F=C E F \\
  A B D&=C D E=A C F=B E F
\end{align}
]

### Resolution

A fractional design has resolution $R$ if no $p$-factor effect is aliased with
an effect containing less than $R - p$ factors.

| $R$ | $p$ | $< R - p$ | Interpretation |
|- | - | --- | ------- |
| 3 | 1 |  $\leq 2$ | Main effects aren't aliased with other main effects, but could be aliased with two-way interactions | 
| 4 | 1 | $\leq 3$ | Main effects aren't aliased with any other main effects or with any two-way interactions, but could be aliased with three-way interactions | 
|  | 2 | $\leq 2$ | Two-way interactions aren’t aliased with main effects.
| 5 | 1 | $\leq 4$ | Main effects aren’t aliased with other main effects, two-way, or three way interactions. | 
| | 2 | $\leq 3$ | Two-way interactions aren’t aliased with with main effects or two-way interactions. |

A table of fractional factorial designs and their resolutions is available in
the appendix of the textbook. They can be looked up based on the design's
generator.

---

### Resolution

The resolution is 4. Two-way interactions are confounded with one another, but
not with any main effects.

.pull-left[
\begin{align}
  I&=A B C E=B C D F=A D E F \\
  A&=B C E=D E F=A B C D F \\
  B&=A C E=C D F=A B D E F \\
  C&=A B E=B D F=A C D E F \\
  D&=B C F=A E F=A B C D E \\
  E&=A B C=A D F=B C D E F \\
  F&=B C D=A D E=A B C E F \\
  A B&=C E=A C D F=B D E F \\
\end{align}
]

.pull-right[
\begin{align}
  A C&=B E=A B D F=C D E F \\
  A D&=E F=B C D E=A B C F \\
  A E&=B C=D F=A B C D E F \\
  A F&=D E=B C E F=A B C D \\
  B D&=C F=A C D E=A B E F \\
  B F&=C D=A C E F=A B D E \\
  A C D&=B D E=A B F=C E F \\
  A B D&=C D E=A C F=B E F
\end{align}
]

### Injection Modeling Dataset

.pull-left[
This dataset has 6 factors,
* A: mold temperature
* B: screw speed
* C: holding time
* D: cycle time
* E: gate size
* F: holding pressure

and the response variable is mold shrinkage.
]

.pull-right[
We will use the $2^{6 - 2}$ design that we just built.
```{r, echo = TRUE}
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
code <- function(x) ifelse(x == '-', -1, 1)
injection <- read_table2("https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/uxd6sryqz32gbubwfhbdvsnqqkplqqef.txt") %>%
  mutate_at(vars(A:F), code)
head(injection, 4)
```
]

---

### Alias Groups

.pull-left[
* From the full model, we can determine the largest effects
* The `aliases` function from last lecture can still be used
* There are many aliases, but skimming through quickly confirms that the design is resolution 4 (like we deduced earlier)
]

.pull-right[
```{r, echo = TRUE}
fit <- lm(Shrinkage ~ A * B * C * D * E * F, injection)
aliases(fit)
```
]

---

### Daniel Plot

.pull-left[
Based on the Daniel plot, it seems that a submodel based on just A, B, and AB
should be sufficient (perhaps an argument could be made for ACD and AD, though).
]

.pull-right[
```{r, fig.width = 3.5, fig.height = 5, echo = TRUE, out.width = 250}
daniel_plot(2 * coef(fit)[-1], ylim = c(-10, 45))
```
]

---

### Fitted Submodel

.pull-left[
Both mold temperature and screw speed affect shrinkage. Moreover, there is an
interaction; i.e., screw speed has a different effect on shrinkage depending on
the underlying mold temperature.
]

.pull-right[
```{r, echo = TRUE}
fit <- lm(Shrinkage ~ A * B, data = injection)
summary(aov(fit))
```
]

### Exercise

This walks through Problem 8.10 in the textbook. 

.pull-left[
Analyze the [data](https://tinyurl.com/37cznbt6) (https://tinyurl.com/37cznbt6)
in Problem 6.26 as if it came from a  design with $I=ABCD$. Project the design
into a full factorial in the subset of the original four factors that appear to
be significant.
]

.pull-right[
6.26:	In a process development study on yield, four factors were studied, each
at two levels: time (A), concentration (B), pressure (C), and temperature (D). 

a. Construct a Daniel plot. Which factors have large effects?

b. Conduct an ANOVA using the Daniel plot for guidance. What are your conclusions?

c. Write down a regression model relating yield to important process variables.
]

---

We first read in the data and manually code the factors. Next, we filter to the
rows where $ABCD = 1$, to simulate a $2 ^ {4 - 1}$ design.

```{r, echo = TRUE}
experiment <- read_csv("https://tinyurl.com/37cznbt6") %>%
  mutate(
    A = ifelse(A == 3, 1, -1),
    B = ifelse(B == 18, 1, -1),
    C = ifelse(C == 80, 1, -1),
    D = ifelse(D == 250, 1, -1)
  ) %>%
  filter(A * B * C * D == 1)
```

---

From the Daniel plot, the terms $AC, C, A, BC$ and $D$ stand out. Note that we
adjusted the `probs` argument so that the effects had tails that were heavier
than normal.

```{r, echo = TRUE, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 3, out.width = 800}
fit <- lm(Yield ~ A * B * C * D, experiment)
effects <- 2 * coef(fit)[-1]
daniel_plot(effects, c(0.2, 0.3), ylim = c(-4.8, 4.8)) # need heavier tails than normal for plot to make sense
```

---

.pull-left[
```{r, echo = TRUE}
aliases(fit)
```
]

.pull-right[
The alias groups, together with the fact that the A and D (but not B) main
effects are significant, suggest that the displayed BC effect actually an AD
interaction.
]

---

Based on the Daniel plot, we should fit the model `A + D + A:C + A:D`, which is
equivalent to `A * (C + D)`. All effects are marginally significant. With so few
samples, it is hard to claim that these effects are definitively real, but they
all seem worth following up.

```{r, echo = TRUE, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 2.6}
fit <- lm(Yield ~ A * (C + D), experiment)
summary(aov(fit))
```

---

We can project the design down to factors A, C, and D. In the projection, the
data look like a full factorial.

```{r}
experiment %>%
  select(A, C, D, Yield)
```
