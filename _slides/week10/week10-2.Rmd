### Statistical Experimental Design

---

### Today

* Book Sections: 8.1 - 8.2
* Online Notes: Week 10 [4]

---

### Motivation

* The number of samples required for a $2^{K}$ design grows exponentially with $K$
* From 4 to 7 factors doesn't sound like a large change, but there is a
substantial cost difference between collecting 16 and 128 samples
* Fractional factorial designs offer a compromise between (1) completely
ignoring some interesting factors and (2) having to arrange very intensive,
$2^{K}$ factorial experiments

---

### Main Ideas

* Sparsity of Effects: It’s often safe to assume that high-order interactions
are rare.
* Heredity: It is unusual for an interaction to be significant without the
  corresponding main effects also being significant. 
  - It would be unusual for $AB$ be significant without at least one
  of $A$ or $B$ being significant.

---

### Discussion

* We are interested in three factors, A, B, and C
* We have a budget of 4 samples
* Which factor configurations should we consider sampling?
  - i.e., which corners of the cube?

---

### A Bad Choice

```{r, out.width = 700}
include_graphics("https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/gu87vet64i970eonsbvtds7bsb31qbuy.png")
```

---

### A Better Choice

```{r, out.width = 700, fig.cap="A more sensible fraction of samples to take."}
include_graphics("https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/mmj9mcixl4y0o95hwf7h93vayw0eooc0.png")
```

---

### Automatic Procedure

* This choice of a subsample of points is called a "fraction" of the original $2^{K}$ design
* For the $2^3$ design, we were able to find a reasonable fraction by trial
and error
  - Is there a more automatic way to find good fractions?

---

### Setup

Consider the $2^2$ design.

| label | A | B |  AB |
|--- | --- | --- | --- |
| (1) | - | - | + |
| a | + | - | - |
| b | - | + | - |
| ab | + | + | + |

---

### Extension

* To extend this design to 3 factors, set $C = AB$
* This is based on the sparsity of effects principle
  - We won't be able to tell the difference between an AB or C effect
  - We have to assume there is no AB effect

| label | A | B |  AB | C |
|---| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (c) | - | - | + | + |
| a | + | - | - | - |
| b | - | + | - | - |
| abc | + | + | + | + |

---

### Selected Samples

* These are the same points shown on the cube earlier
* The fact that we found this fraction by setting a main effect equal to an
interaction term is not a coincidence

.pull-left[
| label | A | B |  AB | C |
|---| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (c) | - | - | + | + |
| a | + | - | - | - |
| b | - | + | - | - |
| abc | + | + | + | + |
]

.pull-right[
```{r, fig.cap="A more sensible fraction of samples to take."}
include_graphics("https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/mmj9mcixl4y0o95hwf7h93vayw0eooc0.png")
```
]

---

### Vocabulary

* $2^{K - 1}$: This denotes a fractional factorial design with $K$ factors but
only $\frac{1}{2}$ of the samples of a full $2^{K}$ design.
* Generators: In the example, we set $C = AB$. Multiplying by $C$
and using $C^2 = I$, we find $ABC = I$. $ABC$ is called the generator of the fraction.
* Complementary fraction: This is the fractional factorial
design are the corners on which we didn’t take samples. This can be run in a
follow-up experiment.

```{r, out.width = 300, fig.cap = "An example complementary fraction."}
include_graphics("https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/pffnjyav7wexbujzf32vlhorcfxhfa6w.png")
```

---

### Aliasing

Above, we assumed that AB was null. Suppose that it weren’t. Notice that the
contrasts used for the pairs below are all equal,
\begin{align*}
	 \left[AB\right] &= \frac{1}{2}\left(c - a + b + abc\right) = \left[C\right] \\
		\left[BC\right] &= \frac{1}{2}\left(-c + a - b + abc\right) = \left[A\right] \\
		\left[AC\right] &= \frac{1}{2}\left(-c - a + b + abc\right) = \left[B\right]
\end{align*}
  and we have no conclusive way of distinguishing between these *aliased* effects.
  
---

### Aliasing

* To denote this unidentifiability, we will use bracket notation, for example,
\begin{align*}
  \left[A\right] &= A + BC.
\end{align*}
* Aliasing is typically resolved by invoking either the hereditary principle or
domain knowledge. 
  
---

### Resolution

A fractional design has resolution $R$ if no $p$-factor effect is aliased with
an effect containing less than $R - p$ factors.

| $R$ | $p$ | $< R - p$ | Interpretation |
|- | - | --- | ------- |
| 3 | 1 |  $\leq 2$ | Main effects aren't aliased with other main effects, but could be aliased with two-way interactions | 
| 4 | 1 | $\leq 3$ | Main effects aren't aliased with any other main effects or with any two-way interactions, but could be aliased with three-way interactions | 
|  | 2 | $\leq 2$ | Two-way interactions aren’t aliased with main effects.
| 5 | 1 | $\leq 4$ | Main effects aren’t aliased with other main effects, two-way, or three way interactions. | 
| | 2 | $\leq 3$ | Two-way interactions aren’t aliased with with main effects or two-way interactions. |

A table of fractional factorial designs and their resolutions is available in
the appendix of the textbook. They can be looked up based on the design's
generator.

### Recipe: $2^{K - 1}$ Designs

1. Create a full factorial for all but one effect.
2. Define an aliasing pattern for the left out effect by choosing a generator.
3. Multiply columns in the high-order interactions to determine in which
samples the aliased main effect should be present.
4. Analyze data in the same way as before (plot effects, then fit submodel), but paying attention to aliased effects.

---

### Example: Step (1)

We are interested in factors A, B, C, and D. We will alias B.

| A | C | D |
| - | - | - |
| + | - | - |
| - | + | - |
| + | + | - |
| - | - | + |
| + | - | + | 
| - | + | + |
| + | + | + |

---

### Example: Step (2) and (3)

We have set $B = ACD$.

| A | C | D | B |
| - | - | - | - |
| + | - | - | + |
| - | + | - | + |
| + | + | - | - |
| - | - | + | + |
| + | - | + | - |
| - | + | + | - |
| + | + | + | + |

---

### Example: Step (2) and (3)

The generator corresponding to $B = ACD$ can be found by multiplying both sides by $B$,

\begin{align*}
B = ACD \implies B ^ 2 = ACDB = ABCD \implies I = ABCD
\end{align*}

where we used (1) the fact that any column squared is the identity (+'s and -'s both
become + when squaring) and (2) the fact that we can reorder letters in the effects.

---

### Example: Step (2) and (3)

The associated aliasing pattern can be found by multiplying the generator by
different effects,

.pull-left[
\begin{align*}
I = ABCD \implies A = A^2 BCD = BCD \\
\implies B = A B^2 CD = ACD \\
\implies C = A B C^2 D = ABD \\
\implies AB = A^2 B^2 CD = CD \\
\implies AC = A ^ 2 B  C^2 D = BD \\
\end{align*}
]

.pull-right[
\begin{align*}
AD = A ^ 2 B  C^2 D = BD \\
BC = A B^2 C^2 D = AD \\
BD = A B^2 C D^2 = AC \\
CD = A B C^2 D ^ 2 = AB \\
\end{align*}
]

### Exercise -- Part (1)

This walks through problem 8.8 in the textbook.

.pull-left[
An article describes the use of a replicated fractional factorial to investigate the effect of five factors on the free height of leaf springs used in an automotive application. The factors are A = furnace temperature, B = heating time, C = transfer time, D = hold down time, and E = quench oil temperature.

**(i) Write out the alias structure for this design. What is the resolution?**

(ii) Analyze the data. What factors influence the mean free height?
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
library(readr)
experiment <- read_csv("https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/45uw7mlupit7qczysus599173tr2o9eu.csv")
head(experiment, 4)
```
]

---

### Exercise -- Part (1)

(1) Which column looks like it is a product of the others? Use this to determine
the aliasing structure. _Hint: It is the column with the most irregular structure._

(2) Determine the resolution of this design by inspecting the aliasing
structure. You may refer to the appendix in the textbook.

---

### Solution (1) 

Based on the pattern of +/-, it looks like $D = ABC$. The associated defining
relation is,

\begin{align*}
D = ABC \implies D ^ 2 = ABCD \implies I = ABCD,
\end{align*}

since any column multiplied by itself is the identity.

---

### Solution (2)

This design is described in Table VIII(b) in the appendix. It is a resolution IV
design.

Alternatively, we could work out the aliasing pattern manually by multiplying
the defining relation by different factors. For example,

.pull-left[
\begin{align*}
I = ABCD \implies A = A^2 BCD = BCD \\
\implies B = A B^2 CD = ACD \\
\implies C = A B C^2 D = ABD \\
\implies AB = A^2 B^2 CD = CD \\
\implies AC = A ^ 2 B  C^2 D = BD \\
\end{align*}
]

.pull-right[
\begin{align*}
AD = A ^ 2 B  C^2 D = BD \\
BC = A B^2 C^2 D = AD \\
BD = A B^2 C D^2 = AC \\
CD = A B C^2 D ^ 2 = AB \\
\end{align*}
]

Since main effects are only confounded with three-way interactions and since
two-way interactions are only confounded with other two-way interactions, we
have that this is a resolution IV design.

# Code Implementation

### Filtration Data

We will work with the filtration dataset, but pretending that we had run a $2^{4 - 1}$ design using the word $ABCD$. The `filter` step reduces the full factorial into the imagined fractional factorial.

```{r}
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
code <- function(x) ifelse(x == '-', -1, 1)
filtration <- read_table2("https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/xxh05ngikmscnddbhg2l3v268jnu4jtc.txt") %>%
  mutate_at(vars(A:D), code) %>%
  filter(D == A * B * C)
```

---

```{r, echo = FALSE}
daniel_plot <- function(effects, probs = c(0.4, 0.6)) { 
  qq <- qqnorm(effects, datax = TRUE)
  qqline(effects, col = "red", probs = probs, datax = TRUE)
  text(qq$x, qq$y, names(effects), pos=1)
}
```

--- 
### Fitted Full Model

```{r}
library(BsMD)
fit <- lm(Rate ~ A * B * C * D, filtration)
daniel_plot(2 * coef(fit)[-1], prob=c(0.25, 0.3))
```

---

### Aliasing Pattern

.pull-left[
* The aliasing pattern can be found from the design matrix.
* Off diagonal elements of $X^T X$ that are not 0 are aliased effects. The
function on the right finds these aliases.
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(tibble)
library(tidyr)

aliases <- function(fit) {
  X <- model.matrix(fit)
  t(X) %*% X  %>%
    as.data.frame() %>%
    rownames_to_column("effect") %>%
    pivot_longer(-effect, names_to = "alias") %>%
    filter(value != 0, effect != alias) %>%
    select(-value)
}
```
]

---

### Aliasing Pattern

.pull-left[
* The aliasing pattern can be found from the design matrix.
* Off diagonal elements of $X^T X$ that are not 0 are aliased effects. The
function on the right finds these aliases.
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
aliases(fit)
```
]

---

### Interpretation

The important effects seem like $A + BCD$, $BC + AD$, $D + ABC$, $C + ABD$, $AC + BD$.
  
.pull-left[
```{r}
daniel_plot(2 * coef(fit)[-1], prob=c(0.25, 0.3))
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
aliases(fit)
```
]

---

### Interpretation

* Based on the sparsity of effects principle, we should believe in effects for $A, D$, and $C$.
* For the two-way interactions,  $AC$ and $AD$ are more plausible, because the
main effect for $B$ was not significant.

### Exercise -- Part (2)

This walks through exercise 8.8 in the textbook.

.pull-left[
An article describes the use of a replicated fractional factorial to investigate the effect of five factors on the free height of leaf springs used in an automotive application. The factors are A = furnace temperature, B = heating time, C = transfer time, D = hold down time, and E = quench oil temperature.

(i) Write out the alias structure for this design. What is the resolution?

**(ii) Analyze the data. What factors influence the mean free height?**

]

.pull-right[

```{r}
library(readr)
experiment <- read_csv("https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/45uw7mlupit7qczysus599173tr2o9eu.csv") %>%
  mutate_at(vars(A:E), code)
head(experiment, 4)
```
]

---

### Exercise --- Part (2)

(1) Reshape the data so that all replicates are contained in one column.

(2) Make a Daniel or Lenth plot based on effects estimated from a model with all interactions. Which effects seem relevant?

(3) Refit a submodel based on the analysis in (4). Report significant effects
and interpret them based on the sparsity of effects and hereditary principles.

---

### Solution (1)

```{r}
experiment_long <- experiment %>%
  pivot_longer(Rep1:Rep3, names_to = "replicate", values_to = "height")
head(experiment_long)
```

---

### Solution (2) 

It looks like A, B, E, and BE have an influence on free height.

```{r, fig.width = 12, fig.height = 4.2, out.width = 500}
daniel_plot <- function(effects, probs = c(0.4, 0.6)) { 
  qq <- qqnorm(effects, datax = TRUE)
  qqline(effects, col = "red", probs = probs, datax = TRUE)
  text(qq$x, qq$y, names(effects), pos=1)
}
fit <- lm(height ~ A * B * C * D * E, experiment_long)

daniel_plot(2 * coef(fit)[-1], prob = c(0.2, 0.8))
```

---

### Solution (3)

Based on the earlier exercise, there is no aliasing between any of the effects
included in the submodel (it is a resolution IV design). Therefore, each term
can be interpreted in the typical way. For example, changing the furnace
temperature from the low to the high setting increases the free height by 0.12
units.

```{r}
lm(height ~ A + B * E, experiment_long)
```
