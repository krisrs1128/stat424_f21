### Statistical Experimental Design

### Today

* Book Sections: 8.1 - 8.2
* Online Notes: Week 10 [4]

---

### Motivation

* The number of samples required for a $2^{K}$ design grows exponentially with $K$
* From 4 to 7 factors doesn't sound like a large change, but there is a
substantial cost difference between collecting 16 and 128 samples
* Fractional factorial designs offer a compromise between (1) completely
ignoring some interesting factors and (2) having to arrange very intensive,
$2^{K}$ factorial experiments

---

### Main Ideas

  * Sparsity of Effects: Itâ€™s often safe to assume that high-order interactions
  are rare.
  * Heredity: It is unusual for an interaction to be significant without the
  corresponding main effects also being significant. 
  - It would be unusual for $A \times B$ be significant without at least one
  of $A$ or $B$ being significant.

---

### Discussion

* We are interested in three factors, A, B, and C
* We have a budget of 4 samples
* Which factor configurations should we consider sampling?
  - i.e., which corners of the cube?

---

### A Bad Choice

```{r}
include_graphics("https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/gu87vet64i970eonsbvtds7bsb31qbuy.png")
```

---

### A Better Choice

```{r, fig.cap="A more sensible fraction of samples to take."}
include_graphics("https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/mmj9mcixl4y0o95hwf7h93vayw0eooc0.png")
```

---

### Automatic Procedure

* This choice of a subsample of points is called a "fraction" of the original $2^{K}$ design
* For the $2^3$ design, we were able to find a reasonable fraction by trial
and error
  - Is there a more automatic way to find good fractions?

| (1) | - | - | + |
| a | + | - | - |
| b | - | + | - |
| ab | + | + | + |
