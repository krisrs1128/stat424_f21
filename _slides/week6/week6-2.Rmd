### Statistical Experimental Design

### Today

* Book Sections: 5.1 - 5.2
* Online Notes: Week 6 [2]

---

### Motivation

* So far, we've only ever had one factor of interest
  - Other factors were always nuisance factors
* What should we do when multiple factors are of interest?
 - This is the most common situation in practice
* This lecture introduces some useful terminology and visualizations

---

### Examples

* How do temperature and material both influence battery life?
* How do assembly line parameters affect product quality?
* How does button placement and color affect click through rate?
* How do several abiotic stresses (salinity, temperature, ...) affect plant
growth?

---

### Two Factor Designs

* The simplest multi-factor design is the two factor design
* A design with $L$ levels per factor and $K$ factors is called an $L^K$ design
  - We will usually have $L = 2$
* The simplest two factor design has only two levels for each factor
  - This is a $2^2$ design
  
---

### Visualization

* In the $2^2$ design, the configurations of factors can be organized as corners
on a square
* For general $2^K$ designs, a subset of factors has to be chosen for each plot
    
.pull-left[
```{r, fig.cap = "A two factor experiment viewed in 3D."}
include_graphics("figure/22_factorial.png")
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r, fig.cap = "A two factor experiment viewed from the top down."}
include_graphics("figure/22_factorial_flat.png")
```
]

---

### Data Collection

* To collect data for a factorial experiment, collect replicates from each
configuration of the $K$ factors
* For large $K$, there can be many configurations
  - We will explore methods to avoid sampling every single configuration

---

### Main Effects

* The _main effect_ of a factor is defined as the average change in the response
when increasing that factor by one unit
* The average is taken over values of all other factors

---

### Interaction Effects

* The change in response when a factor is changed might depend on the specific
configuration of another (or several other) factors
* This is called an _interaction effect_ between factors

```{r, fig.cap = "A two factor experiment with an interaction effect, viewed in 3D"}
include_graphics("figure/22_factorial_interaction.png")
```

```{r, fig.cap = "A two factor experiment with an interaction effect, viewed from the top down"}
include_graphics("figure/22_factorial_flat_interaction.png")
```

---

### Model

.pull-left[
\begin{align*}
y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \beta_{12} x_{1} x_{2}
\end{align*}
]

.pull-right[
* When $\beta_{12}$ is nonzero, there is an interaction between $x_1$ and $x_2$.
* In this case, the slopes of $x_1$ and $x_2$ are not fixed, and each depends on the value of the other variable.
* This can be interpreted as a "synergy" effect
* This results in curvature of the 3D surface
]

---

### Interactions

.pull-left[
\begin{align*}
y &= \beta_0 + \left(\beta_1 + x_{12}\right)x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 \\
  &= \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \left(\beta_2 + \beta_{12}x_{1}\right) x_2
\end{align*}
]
.pull-right[
* When $\beta_{12}$ is nonzero, there is an interaction between $x_1$ and $x_2$.
* In this case, the slopes of $x_1$ and $x_2$ are not fixed, and each depends on the value of the other variable.
* This can be interpreted as a "synergy" effect
* This results in curvature of the 3D surface
]

### Exercise

Option A: What is the interpretation of a coefficient $\beta_{12}$ that is large
and positive? large and negative?
Option B: An study of battery manufacturing data reports that there is a strong
interaction between material and temperature factors when modeling battery
lifetime. What does this mean, in your own words?
