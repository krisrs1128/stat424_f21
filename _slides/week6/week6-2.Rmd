### Statistical Experimental Design

### Today

* Book Sections: 5.1 - 5.2
* Online Notes: Week 6 [2]

---

### Motivation

* So far, we've only ever had one factor of interest
  - Other factors were always nuisance factors
* What should we do when multiple factors are of interest?
 - This is the most common situation in practice
* This lecture introduces some useful terminology and visualizations

---

### Examples

* How do temperature and material both influence battery life?
* How do assembly line parameters affect product quality?
* How does button placement and color affect click through rate?
* How do several abiotic stresses (salinity, temperature, ...) affect plant
growth?

---

### Two Factor Designs

* The simplest multi-factor design is the two factor design
* A design with $L$ levels per factor and $K$ factors is called an $L^K$ design
  - We will usually have $L = 2$
* The simplest two factor design has only two levels for each factor
  - This is a $2^2$ design
  
---

### Visualization

* In the $2^2$ design, the configurations of factors can be organized as corners
on a square
* For general $2^K$ designs, a subset of factors has to be chosen for each plot

```

### Data Collection

* To collect data for a factorial experiment, collect replicates from each
configuration of the $K$ factors
* For large $K$, there can be many configurations
  - We will explore methods to avoid sampling every single configuration

---

### Main Effects

* The _main effect_ of a factor is defined as the average change in the response
when increasing that factor by one unit
* The average is taken over values of all other factors

---

### Interaction Effects

* The change in response when a factor is changed might depend on the specific
configuration of another (or several other) factors
* This is called an _interaction effect_ between factors

```{r, fig.cap = "A two factor experiment with an interaction effect, viewed in 3D", out.width = 450}
include_graphics("https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/z0oxu2ir9tqdxzfcduq67tuqpiblar3r.png")
```

### Model

.pull-left[
\begin{align*}
y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \beta_{12} x_{1} x_{2}
\end{align*}
]

.pull-right[
* When $\beta_{12}$ is nonzero, there is an interaction between $x_1$ and $x_2$.
* In this case, the slopes of $x_1$ and $x_2$ are not fixed, and each depends on the value of the other variable.
* This can be interpreted as a "synergy" effect
* This results in curvature of the 3D surface
]

---

### Interactions

.pull-left[
\begin{align*}
y &= \beta_0 + \left(\beta_1 + x_{12}\right)x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 \\
  &= \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \left(\beta_2 + \beta_{12}x_{1}\right) x_2
\end{align*}
]
.pull-right[
* When $\beta_{12}$ is nonzero, there is an interaction between $x_1$ and $x_2$.
* In this case, the slopes of $x_1$ and $x_2$ are not fixed, and each depends on the value of the other variable.
* This can be interpreted as a "synergy" effect
* This results in curvature of the 3D surface
]

### Exercise

Option A: What is the interpretation of a coefficient $\beta_{12}$ that is large
and positive? large and negative?

Option B: An study of battery manufacturing data reports that there is a strong
interaction between material and temperature factors when modeling battery
lifetime. What does this mean, in your own words?

---

### Solution (A)

A large positive coefficient $\beta_{12}$ means that the observed value when
both factors are active is larger than would be expected by simply adding the
effects from either on their own. There is a synergy that leads to an especially high response when both are present.

A large negative coefficient has the opposite interpretation. In this case, the
observed value when both values are active is smaller than simply adding either
on their own. The two factors dampen each others effects.

---

### Solution B

* Across materials, the effect of temperature is not the same. For example, for
material 1, an increase by 10 degrees might increase battery lifetime, but for
material 2, the same increase might decrease lifetime.
* The same logic works symmetrically. For different temperatures, the effect on
lifetime of using material 1 vs. 2 might not be the same.
