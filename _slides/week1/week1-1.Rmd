### Statistical Experimental Design

.large[Kris Sankaran | UW Madison | 9 September 2021]

---

### Plan for today

1. Review syllabus (10 min)
2. Motivation and Expectations (20 min)
3. Principles of Experimental Design (45 min)

---

### Today's Learning Outcomes

- Discuss potential confounding in an observed association
- Distinguish between a repeated measure and a true replicate
- Recognize situations where nuisance factors might wash out interesting variation
- Decide when an interaction term would be useful to include

---
### Today's Learning Outcomes

In other words,

> Realize that drawing correct inferences can be tricky -- but we'll spend the
semester learning useful problem solving strategies

# Randomization

---

### Randomization

.pull-left[
* Suppose we are comparing a new disease treatment with a control, to see
whether the treatment improves outcomes
* The randomization principle says we should flip a coin to decide who does /
doesn't get the treatment
]

.pull-right[
.highlight-comment[
Why??
ðŸª™
]
]

---

### Randomization

* Suppose we only give the treatment to the sickest people
* They have the most room to improve, no matter the treatment
* We might believe in a treatment effect that doesn't exist

---

### Randomization

If we randomly assign treatments, we would not see the (spurious) effect.

---

### Randomization

If an effect does exist (on average, across all people), we will estimate it
accurately.

1. Are there explanations for this pattern that are not "more recent music
genres are more dangerous"?
2. What would the hypothetical randomized experiment look like?

# Replication

---

### Replication

* We are measuring what types of factors (sunlight, water, soil type) help
plants grow
* Suppose we assign exactly one plant to each combination of factors

```{r}
data.frame(
  sunlight = c("low", "low", "high", "high"),
  water = c("low", "high", "low", "high"),
  height = 5 + 2 * runif(4)
)
```

---

### Replication

* We have no estimate of typical variation within a factor combination. It could
have been random chance that the plant in one configuration grew so tall.
* There is no way of telling whether one combination is better than another

```{r}
data.frame(
  sunlight = c("low", "low", "high", "high"),
  water = c("low", "high", "low", "high"),
  height = 5 + 2 * runif(4)
)
```

### Replication

The more measurements we make, the better our estimates will be

### Replication vs. Repeated Measures

.pull-left[
* A computer chip manufacturer wants many 
measurements per factor combination
* Building chips is expensive, so they take many measurements from the same chip

### Replication vs. Repeated Measures

.pull-left[
* This fails to account for chip-to-chip variation
* Having 10 measurements each for 2 chips is not the same as having measurements
for 20 different chips

# Blocking

### Blocking

* Suppose you work for a shoe company that wants to compare two new types of
shoe soles (A and B). Which one wears out the fastest?
* Our colleague, having heard about randomization, says we should randomly
assign each person to either A or B
* What could go wrong?

### Blocking

.pull-left[There is so much person-to-person variation, that it might be hard to tell
whether the sole type had any effect]

### Blocking

.pull-left[
* We instead give each person one of each sole type
* We can now see whether one sole always lasts longer than the other, on a
per-person level

### Canvas Lecture 1 - Exercise 2

.pull-left[
Charles Darwin wanted to compare two the growth of two varieties of corn (Zea
mays). He grew the plants in pots, but thought there might be effects coming
from the soil and amount of sunlight each pot received.
 
How do you think he accounted for this pot-to-pot variation in his experiments?
