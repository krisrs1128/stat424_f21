### Statistical Experimental Design

## Manipulating Factors

Most of experimental design abstracts away a system into a series of input
factors and an outcome of interest,

$$
\text{outcome} = f\left(\text{factor}_1, \dots, \text{factor}_K \right)
$$

Most of experimental design abstracts away a system into a series of input
factors and an outcome of interest,

$$
\text{golf score} = f\left(\text{driver type}, \text{type of ball}\right)

factors and an outcome of interest,

## $2^2$ Design

.pull-left[
* Two binary factors = corners of a square
* We could try approximating the responses using 
$$
y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \epsilon,
$$
  where $x_j \in \{0, 1\}$ encodes whether factor $j$ is on or off and $\epsilon$ is random noise from one run to the next.

## Interaction Terms

.pull-left[
* The approximation is poor if the edges are not parallel
* Consider the richer model, 
\begin{align}
y = &\beta_{0} + \beta_{1}x_{1} + \beta_{2}x_{2} +\\
&\beta_{12}x_{1}x_{2} + \epsilon.
\end{align}
* What are the slopes in the figure to the right?

## Samples to Distributions

.pull-left[
We could imagine a distribution of response values for each
factor combination, even though we only have finite samples.

## $2^K$ Design

.pull-left[
If we had $K$ binary factors, we could still imagine a different distribution
for each factor combination.

## $2^K$ Design

.pull-left[
* What is the influence of each individual factor?
* Are there factors that have no effect? (Factor Screening)
* Are there combinations that maximize the response? (Process Optimization)
