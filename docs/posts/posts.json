There are many factors besides treatment that can influence outcome. You don’t want those to bias your conclusions.\nExample [Treating sickest patients] * If we don’t randomize, we might end up only treating sicker patients than usual. If the sickest patients are the ones who would end up improving the most either way, we might fool ourselves into thinking the treatment works. * If we randomize, the differences coming from these extraneous factors (like amount of sickness) will cancel out. * Though, if there had been a difference, you’d still be able to detect it.\n\n\ninclude_graphics(\"https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/cmm759fivv4g0xsg85k25b1cq32zn7gp.png\")\n\n\n\ninclude_graphics(\"https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/y531b9lly0twl9i987978dqp8kwzfze5.png\")\n\n\n\ninclude_graphics(\"https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/t4btwq8hyhkt14kcn0p2o8rwzg2magqa.png\")\n\n\n\n\nReplication\n\nAn independent run of each factor combination – Montgomery, pg. 12\n\nIf you had only grown the plant once, you’d have no idea about typical variation.

One approach is based on hypothesis testing: we have a theory about the general (a null hypothesis), and we want to see whether our specific sample is consistent with that theory.\nThere’s a general recipe, * Pose a null hypothesis about the world * Define a test statistic that should detect departures from that null hypothesis * Determine a reference distribution for that test statistic * Compute the test statistic on your data, and see if it’s plausibly a draw from your reference distribution\n\n\ninclude_graphics(\"https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/e2vep3vvfvnz8v4kiilim1pjxe2w2upr.png\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninclude_graphics(\"https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/66793m770ob31z53fpgc4xoci4y0s7fi.png\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninclude_graphics(\"https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/r9dzi8ar8l7ic7h2xarnrdiwoab6tojz.png\")\n\n\n\n\nTypes of Error\nTest rejected Test didn’t reject Null is true False alarm Correct Null is false Correct Missed detection\nThe probability that a test will correctly detect a true departure from the null is called its power.\np-values “Rejected” or “Not rejected” is a very coarse description p-values give a measure of the degree of (im)plausibility of a test statistic under a given null hypothesis Two Sample t-test\nMotivating example: You have two ways of making concrete mortar.

(consider what happens when n1 = n2 = n)\nUnder the null hypothesis, this is a ratio between a standard normal and chi-square, so t0 is t-distributed with n - 2 df.

For example, How does the etch rate of a tool depend on its power setting? How do an opera company’s different donation strategies compare with one another? How does the average rental time compare across cars?\nVisually, it can be used whenever the data can be arranged as a series of boxplots. Model and Test Setup Formally, consider the model\nwhere i=1, , a and j=1, , n and the errors ijN(0, 2) are independent.\ni indexes different groups j indexes the samples within groups. a is the number of groups n is the number of samples in each group N=na is the total number of samples\nOur null hypothesis is that none of the groups deviate from the global mean. The alternative is that at least one of the groups is different. Formally,\nImportant Identities The word “analysis” in ANOVA is used in the classical sense of to break something into its parts. ANOVA breaks the observed variation into distinct components,\nwhich is abbreviated as\nSStotal = SStreatments + SSerror.\nIf any of the groups had a mean that was different from the global mean, then you’d expect the treatment term to be larger than it would otherwise be. How large is large enough to reject?\nSince the variance within each group is 2, the variance of each yi is 2n. The blue term looks like how we would usually estimate the variances of the yi, i.e.,\nOn the other hand, under the null, all the yijN(,2), so we would also know,\nSo under the null,\nbut otherwise it would be larger.\nNote that the numerator and denominator are chi-squares, with a - 1 and N - a df, respectively. It’s not obvious, but they’re also independent (this is called Cochran’s theorem). Therefore, the null reference is an F distribution with (a - 1, N - a) df.

There are a few ways that this model can fail, There might be systematic variations besides the group deviations i. The errors might not be normally distributed The errors might not be independent The variance might not be the same in each group\nTo see if the model is okay, it will be helpful to define residuals,\n. Residuals are our best guess of what the true random error ij is like. Normal Probability Plots\nWe can’t check normality of ijdirectly, but we can check normality of the residuals eij using normal probability plots.\nIn the plot to the right, it looks like the data are somewhat more tightly clustered near the middle, though the most extreme points are more extreme than expected. Do you see why?\nOf the ways that the model can fail, normality of the residuals is not the most severe, because you can often count on the central limit theorem to make the reference F distribution still approximately correct. Plotting Residuals The way to check for systematic variation beyond the i’s, try plotting residuals against measured variables. If you see “patterns”, those represent missing terms in your model. Use plots to check for independence. For example, if you plot the residuals over time and you see clear trends, then the errors are likely correlated over time. Plotting residuals against the fitted values. This can reveal nonconstant variance across the groups. Testing Equality of Variances There are formal tests to test whether the equal variance assumption of the ANOVA is valid (it’s sort of meta). The most common are, Bartlett’s test The Modified Levene test The main difference is that the Modified Levene test is still valid even when the errors are not normally distributed. You don’t need to memorize the test statistics, but know that they exist, and be able to interpret associated computer output. Transformations What can you do if you detect nonconstant variance across groups? The most common fix is to use a variance stabilizing transformation. That is, apply some function f(x) to each data point and then perform the ANOVA.\nThere are various rules of thumb, though the process is still somewhat informal, f(x) =x or f(x) =1 + x If your data seem Poisson f(x) =(x): If your data seem lognormal f(x) =(x ): If your data are binomial in fraction form\nThese are special cases. More generally, if you notice , then setting f(x) = x1 - will stabilize the variance.\n(It’s not at all obvious why any of these transformations are effective – they are typically derived in introductory mathematical statistics courses).\n\n\n\n",

A contrast is a linear combination of the means,\nFor any particular c, we test\nTo see that this is actually something worth doing, consider the case that we have 4 different means, 1, 2, 3, 4, c = (1, 1, -1, -1): Are the first two means different from the last two, on average? c = (1, -1, 0, 0): Are the first two means equal to each other? etc. Testing Contrasts Remember the hypothesis testing recipe.

But what if we hadn’t planned any, and go in search for significant results using different contrasts?\nImagine testing 100 hypothesis at = 0.05. Suppose they are all null). We would see 5 rejected null hypotheses on average. If we want to allow ourselves some flexibility in searching over contrasts, we need to adapt our methodology. We should control the experimentwise error rate, the probability that any test results in a false positive. Scheffe’s Method Let’s say we’re interested in m contrasts, c1, ,cm. The idea is to widen our confidence intervals slightly, to make false positives rarer.\nHow much should the intervals be widened? It’s not obvious, but Scheffe found that we should multiply the endpoints of each of our m intervals by\n(this is for 95% confidence intervals). Tukey’s Method If we only care about the differences between pairs of group means, we can use Tukey’s method.\nAll the contrasts now have the form,\nWe’re going to make confidence intervals for these, and it’s natural to center them around,\nHow wide should the intervals be?\nTukey found a reference distribution for\nwhere ymax refers to the maximum groups average across the a groups. From there, he tabulated the quantiles as q(a, df).\nIt turns out that the appropriate width of the confidence intervals can be derived from these quantiles,\nThis works because, if the difference between the max and min group averages is contained within this interval, then all pairs i, j of differences are also contained in this interval. Fisher’s Least Significant Difference Fisher’s LSD is used to compare pairs of means Unlike Tukey’s method, it doesn’t control the experimentwise error rate\nNotice that the variance of the differences is\nFisher’s LSD compares each difference |yi- yj| to the cutoff,\nand rejects the null that the pairs have equal means if the difference is larger.\n\n\n\n",

Or, even if you can collect them, having one parameter for each would lead to a clumsy model We instead settle for saying the effect of the factor on average, rather than any specific level\nExamples, Is there a high school effect on college GPA? (instead of effects for individual schools) Is there a loom effect on fiber strength? (don’t care about individual looms)\nModel\nThe model has the form,\nwhere iN(0, 2) and ijN(0, 2). The crucial difference is that i is now thought of as random, not fixed.\nNotice that\nMore generally, the covariance matrix is block diagonal, with blocks of 2 within groups.\nHypothesis Testing\nWe may want to test whether there is any variation in response across factor levels. Formally,\nFor our test statistic, we can use the same one as before,\nand for the same reasons as in fixed-effect ANOVA, this is F-distributed with (a - 1, N - a) df, and we can reject when this is large.\n\n\n\n",

Two ways to fit them are (1) the method of moments and (2) maximum likelihood.\nMethod of Moments\nFor estimating , this method uses the overall mean y.\nWhat about the 2’s? The key identity is,\nWe can approximate the expected values through,\nIf we pretended these approximations were exact equalities, then we have two equations with two unknowns. The method of moments defines parameter estimates as the solutions to that system of equations.\nHow can we get confidence intervals for these estimates?\nFor =y, we can use Var(y)=1NVar(yij)=2+n2N For 2, we can use the fact that (N - a)MSE22N - a For 2, we’re out of luck, though some papers give approximate confidence intervals.\nMaximum Likelihood Estimation\nAn alternative approach is to use maximum likelihood.\nStack all the yij’s into one long length N vector, and observe that the data are jointly normally distributed\nThe specific form of the covariance isn’t important. What is important is that we can exactly evaluate the probability of y11, y12,yan under any choice of the parameters , 2, 2.\nDefine L(, 2, 2) the probability of the dataset y11, y12,yanviewed as a function of the normal distribution’s parameters A good estimate for these parameters comes from finding the configuration that maximizes L(, 2, 2).\nThe maximizers can’t be found analytically, but algorithms exist to find the maximizers Software also gives a confidence interval for the estimates. It works by studying the curvature of the likelihood function at the maximizer, though we don’t need to worry about the details.\n\n\n\n",
