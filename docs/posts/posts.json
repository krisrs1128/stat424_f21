Graphically, the tree of effects grows deeper. Since there are more parameters at deeper levels of nesting, it is often a good idea to fit those parameters using random effects.\nSimultaneous Nesting and Factors\nNested terms can be included in standard factorial models. Consider the following setting (Example 14.2),\nAn industrial engineering is optimizing the assembly time of an electronic device.\nThere are different possible layouts and fixtures of the circuit boards which may influence the time to assembly.\nThe experiment must be run across factories. The operators who do the actual assembly will differ depending on layout.\n\n\n####(readImage(\"https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/ijhv501h8c07j2xvonxcsg4rkhjoh840.png\"))\n\n\n\nThe operator effect is nested within the layout effect. It should also be treated as a random effect, because we want to understand variation across all possible operators, when choosing a particular layout and fixture design. Therefore, a reasonable model is\n\\[\\begin{align*}\ny_{ijkl} &= \\mu + \\alpha_{i} + \\beta_{j} + \\tau_{k\\left(j\\right)} + \\left(\\alpha\\beta\\right)_{ij} + \\left(\\alpha \\tau\\right)_{ik\\left(j\\right)}\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\\(\\alpha_i\\): The fixture effect\n\\(\\beta_j\\): The layout effect\n\\(\\tau_{k\\left(j\\right)}\\): The operator random effect.\n\\(\\left(\\alpha\\beta\\right)_{ij}\\): An interaction effect between fixtures and layouts\n\\(\\left(\\alpha\\tau\\right)_{ik\\left(j\\right)}\\): A random interaction effect between the fixture and the operator.\nSince this model has both random and fixed effect terms, it is called a mixed effects model. It is fit below.\n\n\nassembly <- read_csv(\"https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/gvev45mtp69fb19ng37nlntyiy4x6dmj.csv\") %>%\n  mutate_at(vars(Operator, Layout, Fixture), as.factor)\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(assembly) +\n  geom_point(aes(x = Operator, y = Time)) +\n  facet_grid(Fixture ~ Layout, scale = \"free_x\")\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Assembly time as a function of layout (columns) and fixture (rows).

The fact that there is an interaction between fixtures and operators suggests that the operators who are much worse at some fixtures than others could be retrained.\n\n\n\n",

The irrigation strategies are now rows, and each cell is a subplot.\n\n\n\nThere are times when we would like to perform a two-factor factorial experiment across blocks, but one of the factors is much more difficult to vary than the other. For example,\nWe want to assess the effect of different irrigation (\\(A\\)) and corn varieties (\\(B\\)) on total yield. There are three fields (Blocks) within which to gather data. It is hard to change irrigation strategy on small subplots of land, especially compared to corn variety.\nWe run a papermill, and want to compare pulp preparation strategies (\\(A\\)) and cooking temperatures (\\(B\\)). Samples are collected over three days (Blocks). It is hard to change the pulp preparation strategy from sample to sample — we would rather prepare a few big batches — but it’s easy to cook them at different temperatures.\nThis makes a true \\(2^{2}\\) factorial experiment impractical, because it would require randomizing over all combinations of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) for every sample that we collect.\nIf we had 3 irrigation strategies and 6 corn varieties, we would need to divide each field into 18 subplots and randomize the assignment of irrigation x corn pairs.\nIt’s much easier to first divide each field into 3 large plots, and then randomly assign corn varieties to 6 subplots within each large plot.\nEffectively, practical considerations impose a restriction on randomization.\nModel\nThe model for a split-plot design is\n\\[\\begin{align*}\ny_{ijk} &= \\mu + \\tau_{k} + \\alpha_{i} + \\beta_{j} + \\left(\\tau\\alpha\\right)_{ki} + \\left(\\alpha\\beta\\right)_{ij} + \\epsilon_{ijk}\n\\end{align*}\\]\nwhere \\(\\epsilon \\sim N\\left(0, \\sigma^2\\right)\\) independently.\nThe terms can be interpreted as,\n\\(\\mu\\): The global response average.\n\\(\\tau_{k}\\): The effect of the \\(k^{th}\\) block (e.g., \\(k^{th}\\) field).\n\\(\\alpha_{i}\\): The effect of the \\(i^{th}\\) level of \\(A\\), the hard-to-granularly-randomize factor (e.g., \\(i^{th}\\) irrigation strategy).\n\\(\\beta_{j}\\): The effect of the \\(j^{th}\\) level of \\(B\\), the easy-to-granularly-randomize factor (e.g., \\(j^{th}\\) corn variety)\n\\(\\left(\\tau\\alpha\\right)_{ki}\\): An interaction factor between the \\(k^{th}\\) block and the \\(i^{th}\\) level of \\(A\\) (e.g., the \\(i^{th}\\) irrigation strategy within the \\(k^{th}\\) field might be unusually good).\n\\(\\left(\\alpha\\beta\\right)_{ij}\\): An interaction factor between the \\(i^{th}\\) level of \\(A\\) and the \\(j^{th}\\) level of \\(B\\).\nWe will typically not care about individual block effects, though we will care about the two different treatments. Therefore, it is common to\nUse random effects for \\(\\tau_{k}, \\left(\\tau\\alpha\\right)_{ki}\\).\nUse fixed-effects for \\(\\alpha_{i}\\) and \\(\\beta_{j}\\).\nThe expected mean squares associated with each of the terms above can be derived in closed form.

In many situations, however, effects are nested within each other.\nYou rely on several suppliers to provide raw material and are interested in whether some suppliers provide consistently better material. The material arrives in batches, and there is variation across batches. The batch effect is nested within the supplier effect.\nThe hardness of different alloys are to be compared. Several ingots are built from each alloy, and repeated measures are drawn from each ingot. The ingot effect is nested within the alloy effect.\nModel\n\n\ndisplay(readImage(\"https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/g6yb4uu8nncnqc39rbjhh3kz8bv9jzwc.png\"))\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Notation used in nested designs.

In this case, there are two typical hypotheses of interest.\n\n\ndisplay(readImage(\"https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/6bona7dg8dl6fbnfvetovq2cl9l5zo11.png\"))\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: The nested effect term looks at the variation across child means along a single branch.\n\n\n\nNull parent-effect, \\[\\begin{align*}\n&H_{0}: \\alpha_{i} = 0 \\text{ for all } i \\\\\n&H_{1}: \\alpha_{i} \\neq 0 \\text{ for at least one } i\n\\end{align*}\\]\nNull child-effect, \\[\\begin{align*}\n&H_{0}: \\beta_{j\\left(i\\right)} = 0 \\text{ for all } i,j \\\\\n&H_{1}: \\beta_{j\\left(i\\right)} \\neq 0 \\text{ for at least one } i,j\n\\end{align*}\\]\nIn either case, a test is performed using a sum-of-squares decomposition, \\[\\begin{align*}\nSS_{T} &= SS_A + SS_{B\\left(A\\right)} + SS_{E}\n\\end{align*}\\] which is similar in structure to those we have seen before, except we now have a nested effect term, \\[\\begin{align*}\nSS_{B\\left(A\\right)} &= \\sum_{i = 1}^{a}\\sum_{j = 1}^{b} \\left(\\bar{y}_{ij\\cdot} - \\bar{y}_{i\\cdot\\cdot}\\right)^{2}.\n\\end{align*}\\]\nwhich measures how much the \\(j^{th}\\) effect within parent \\(i\\) varies from the average in that group.

These results don’t immediately apply to response surfaces, though, for two reasons,\nSecond-order response surfaces are not necessarily linear.\nThe experimental region might be irregularly shaped, due to known constraints on operating conditions\nIn this setting, there will be no single design that clearly optimal, like there was before. Instead, the typical strategy is to compute the same optimality criteria from before, but to designs constructed through various heuristics.\nReminder: Optimality Measures\nWe can use the same optimality measures that were studied for linear regression.\n\\(D\\)-optimality reflects the variance in the coefficients of the associated linear model. A \\(D\\)-optimal design has minimal value of \\(\\left|X^{T}X\\right|^{-1}\\).\n\\(G\\)-optimality reflects the pointwise variance of the fitted surface. A \\(G\\)-optimal design minimizes the maximal value of \\(V\\left(\\hat{y}\\left(x\\right)\\right)\\).\n\\(V\\)-optimality also reflects the pointwise variance of the fitted surface, but with less focus on the worst case \\(x\\). A \\(V\\)-optimal design minimizes the average variance, \\(\\int_{R} V\\left(\\hat{y}\\left(x\\right)\\right)dx\\) over the experiment space \\(R\\).\nHeuristics\n\n\ndisplay(readImage(\"https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/9pgowo8mgly6d8mm97t8sm324ggcio0y.png\"))\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: One iteration of the point exchange algorithm, for a constrained response surface design.\n\n\n\n\n\ndisplay(readImage(\"https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/yr2dyd75we3ebp1gwe36r5xe3p8841h8.png\"))\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: One iteration of the point coordinate exchange algorithm, in the same setup.\n\n\n\nOnce a candidate design is proposed, we can evaluate its quality using the measures above. There are various heuristics for proposing new candidate designs,\nPoint exchange\nStart with a grid of points to consider performing runs at.\nSelect a subset (possibly at random).

For example, when making a fiber for a kind of yarn, there are three ingredients (polyethylene, polystyrene, and polypropylene) that are mixed at various fractions. What fraction would optimize the stretchiness of the yarn?\nWe’ll explore this problem as a special case of the general response surface problem.\nGeometry\nThe mixture setting induces specific geometric constraints.\nSuppose there are \\(P\\) total ingredients.\nLet \\(x_{p}\\) denote the fraction of ingredient \\(p\\).\nSince the \\(x_{p}\\) are mixture fractions, we have the constraints,\n\\(x_{p} \\in \\left[0, 1\\right]\\)\n\\(\\sum_{p = 1}^{P} x_{p} = 1\\)\nThe set of \\(x = \\left(x_{1}, \\dots, x_{P}\\right)\\) that satisfy these constraints can be geometrically represented by a simplex.\nCenter point has an equal amount of each ingredient\nCorners have 100% coming from one of the ingredients\nThere is nothing stopping us from fitting a response surface over the simplex.\nDesign Points\nWhat design points should we use?\n\n\nDesignPoints(SLD(3, 3))\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: An example \\((3, 3)\\) simplex lattice design.\n\n\n\n\n\nDesignPoints(SLD(3, 5))\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: An example \\((3, 5)\\) simplex lattice design.\n\n\n\n\n\nDesignPoints(SCD(3))\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Simplex centroid design across 3 mixture elements.\n\n\n\nSimplex lattice design: Choose some \\(m\\) which will reflect the granularity of our design. Consider combinations of integers \\(k_{p} \\in \\{0,1, \\dots, m\\}\\) such that \\(\\sum_{p= 1}^{P} k_{p} = m\\). Each such combination specifies a point \\[\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{1}{m}\\left(k_{1}, \\dots, k_{P}\\right)\n\\end{align*}\\] that is included in the simplex lattice design.\nAn alternative way to specify this is to draw a lattice grid with spacing \\(\\frac{1}{m}\\) in the unit cube, and then discard points that don’t lie in the simplex.\n\nSimplex centroid design\nCorners: Add all \\(P\\) permutations of the vector \\(\\left(1, 0, \\dots, 0\\right)\\).\nEdge midpoints: Add all \\({P \\choose 2}\\) permutations of \\(\\left(\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2}, 0, \\dots, 0\\right)\\). These are midpoints between two corners, and so lie on edges of the simplex.\nFace centroids: Add all \\({P \\choose 3}\\) permutations of \\(\\left(\\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{1}{3}, 0, \\dots, 0\\right)\\) which are the centers of faces defined by three corners.\n.. continue the pattern: For all \\(k \\leq P\\), add all \\({P \\choose k}\\) permutations of \\(\\left(\\frac{1}{k}, \\dots, \\frac{1}{k}, 0, \\dots, 0\\right)\\).\n\nThere are some common variations,\nIt’s common to augment the designs above with center points.\nSometimes it is useful to include axial points, which are samples along rays extending from corners of the simplex\nComputer-generated designs can be used, especially when there are constraints on feasible mixture values.\n\n\nmscd <- SCD(5) %>%\n  mutate(id = row_number()) %>%\n  melt(id.vars = \"id\")\nggplot(mscd) +\n  geom_tile(\n    aes(x = variable, y = id, fill = value)\n  ) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_c() +\n  coord_fixed() +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"right\",\n    axis.text = element_text(size = 8),\n    axis.title = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Simplex centroid design across 5 mixture elements.\n\n\n\nData Example\nWe’ll use the yarn data from Example 11.5.

This motivates the use of blocked designs — how should we think of blocked designs in the context of response surface experiments?\nFirst, let’s build intuition through an example. Suppose we are using a central composite design and \\(K = 2\\), but we can’t complete all 10 runs at once. At most, during a single pass, we can collect 5 samples.\nIdea: Split the factorial and axial samples into two blocks, but tie them together at the center points.\nAny batch effects can be directly estimated through shifts in the average value at the center\nThe main technical condition that generalizes this idea is called block orthogonality. A design is called block orthogonal if,\nEach block \\(X_{b}\\) is orthogonal, i.e., \\(X_{b}^{T}X_{b}\\) = I when we stack all design points for the block into an \\(n_{b} \\times K\\) matrix \\(X_{b}\\).\nFor each factor \\(k\\) and each block \\(b\\), \\[\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{\\sum_{u = 1}^{n_{b}} x_{iu}^{2}}{\\sum_{u = 1}^{N} x_{iu}^{2}} = \\frac{n_{b}}{N}\n\\end{align*}\\] this ensures that no one block has undue influence over the eventual estimates.\nFor arbitrary number of factors \\(K\\), the central composite design turns can be made block orthogonal by dividing into two blocks (factor and axial points, tied at the center). It can be broken into even more blocks for particular choices of block size; this is summarized in Table 11.11.\nCode Example\nWe can use the same code we used to generate central composite designs before, but using the blocks argument.\n\n\ncodings <- list(\n  time_coded ~ (time - 35) / 5,\n  temp_coded ~ (temp - 150) / 5\n)\nccd_design <- ccd(~ time_coded + temp_coded, coding = codings)\nccd_design\n\n\n   run.order std.order     time     temp Block\n1          1         5 35.00000 150.0000     1\n2          2         8 35.00000 150.0000     1\n3          3         2 40.00000 145.0000     1\n4          4         6 35.00000 150.0000     1\n5          5         1 30.00000 145.0000     1\n6          6         4 40.00000 155.0000     1\n7          7         3 30.00000 155.0000     1\n8          8         7 35.00000 150.0000     1\n9          1         6 35.00000 150.0000     2\n10         2         7 35.00000 150.0000     2\n11         3         3 35.00000 142.9289     2\n12         4         4 35.00000 157.0711     2\n13         5         1 27.92893 150.0000     2\n14         6         8 35.00000 150.0000     2\n15         7         5 35.00000 150.0000     2\n16         8         2 42.07107 150.0000     2\n\nData are stored in coded form using these coding formulas ...\ntime_coded ~ (time - 35)/5\ntemp_coded ~ (temp - 150)/5\n\n\n\nggplot(decode.data(ccd_design)) +\n  geom_point(\n    aes(x = time, y = temp, col = Block),\n    position = position_jitter(w = 0.5, h = 0.5),\n    size = 3\n  ) +\n  scale_color_brewer(palette = \"Set2\") + \n  coord_fixed()\n\n\n\n\nSuppose we wanted to block more than just the factorial and the axial runs; for example, we may only be able to run 2 examples per batch. In this case, we might block the factorial runs by confounding a high-order interaction with the blocks. For example, the code below blocks the 32 runs of a \\(2^{5}\\) factorial into blocks of size 8.\n\n\ncodings <- list(\n  time_ ~ (time - 35) / 5,\n  temp_ ~ (temp - 150) / 5,\n  power_ ~ power,\n  rate_ ~ rate,\n  cooling_ ~ cooling\n)\nblocked_ccd <- ccd(~ time_ + temp_ + power_ + rate_ + cooling_, coding = codings, blocks = Block ~ c(time_ * temp_ * power_, power_ * rate_ * cooling_))\n\n\n\nFinally, let’s check the orthogonal blocking property for one of the blocks. Remember, we need to make sure that (1) the design within the block is diagonal and (2) the fraction of norm for a column is proportional to the number of samples within the block. This is checked below for Block 1.\n\n\nggplot(decode.data(blocked_ccd)) +\n  geom_point(\n    aes(x = time, y = temp, col = Block),\n    position = position_jitter(w = 1, h = 1),\n    size = 3, alpha = 0.6\n  ) +\n  scale_color_brewer(palette = \"Set2\") + \n  coord_fixed()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nx <- as.data.frame(blocked_ccd)\nxb <- x[x$Block == 1, ] %>%\n  select(ends_with(\"_\")) %>%\n  as.matrix()\nt(xb) %*% xb # orthogonality\n\n\n         time_ temp_ power_ rate_ cooling_\ntime_        8     0      0     0        0\ntemp_        0     8      0     0        0\npower_       0     0      8     0        0\nrate_        0     0      0     8        0\ncooling_     0     0      0     0        8\n\nsum(xb[, 1]^2) / sum(x$time ^ 2) # ||xb[1]||^2 / ||x[1]||^2\n\n\n[1] 0.1935484\n\n12 / nrow(blocked_ccd) # nb / N\n\n\n[1] 0.1935484\n\n\n\n\n",

One idea is to frame the multiple response surface problem as a constrained optimization.\nDefine acceptable ranges for responses \\(y_{2}\\left(x\\right), \\dots, y_{R}\\left(x\\right)\\) that are important, but not our main focus.\nOptimize the response \\(y_{1}\\left(x\\right)\\) that’s our main focus.\nFormally, we look for a configuration of factors \\(x_{\\ast}\\) that solves the optimization \\[\\begin{align*}\n\\underset{x}{\\text{maximize}}\\medspace &y_{1}\\left(x\\right) \\\\\n\\text{subject to }\\medspace &\\left(y_{2}\\left(x\\right), \\dots, y_{R}\\left(x\\right)\\right) \\in \\mathcal{C}\n\\end{align*}\\]\nwhere \\(C\\) is the predefined acceptable region for the secondary responses.\nDesirability Functions\nThe main downside of the constrained optimization approach is that it forces us to choose one response to prioritize over all others. What if we care about each response more or less equally?\nOne idea is to optimize a sort of (geometric) averaged response, \\[\\begin{align*}\n\\underset{x}{\\text{maximize}}\\medspace \\left[\\prod_{r = 1}^{R} y_{r}\\left(x\\right)\\right]^{\\frac{1}{R}}\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\n\nx_grid <- seq(-1, 1, .01)\nexample_funs <- data.frame(\n  x = x_grid,\n  d_max_0.5 = predict(dMax(0, 1, 0.5),  x_grid),\n  d_max_1 = predict(dMax(0, 1, 1),  x_grid),\n  d_max_2 = predict(dMax(0, 1, 2), x_grid),\n  d_min_0.5 = predict(dMin(-1, 0, 0.5), x_grid),\n  d_min_1 = predict(dMin(-1, 0, 1), x_grid),\n  d_min_2 = predict(dMin(-1, 0, 2), x_grid),\n  d_target_0.5 = predict(dTarget(-1, 0, 1, 0.5, 0.5), x_grid),\n  d_target_1 = predict(dTarget(-1, 0, 1), x_grid),\n  d_target_2 = predict(dTarget(-1, 0, 1, 2, 2), x_grid)\n) %>%\n  melt(id.vars = c(\"x\")) %>%\n  mutate(\n    type = str_replace(variable, \"[\\\\.0-9]+\", \"\"),\n    scale = str_extract(variable, \"[\\\\.0-9]+\")\n  )\nggplot(example_funs) +\n  geom_line(aes(x = x, y = value, col = scale)) +\n  scale_color_brewer(palette = \"Set2\") +\n  facet_grid(type ~ .)\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Example desirability functions, for maximizing, minimizing, and achieving a target response.\n\n\n\nThe issue with this idea is that it treats all responses exactly equally. What if we want to maximize some, but minimize others? What if we want some to be near some target value?\nThe solution is to use desirability functions. A few are plotted below. You can adjust their shape so that the \\(r^{th}\\) desirability function is large for the values of \\(y_{r}\\left(x\\right)\\) which are good (sloping down when you want to minimize, sloping up when you want to maximize).\nThen, instead of optimizing the raw averaged response, we optimize the averaged response after first passing through the desirability functions, \\[\\begin{align*}\n\\underset{x}{\\text{maximize}} \\medspace \\left[\\prod_{r = 1}^{R} d_{r}\\left(y_{r}\\left(x\\right)\\right)\\right]^{\\frac{1}{R}}\n\\end{align*}\\]\nData Example\nFor the chemical problem, we can define a desirability function per response, and then combine them into an overall objective. This is done using the desirability package.\n\n\nd_yield <- dMax(70, 95) # min / max / scale\nd_viscosity <- dTarget(55, 65, 75) # min / target / max\nd_weight <- dMin(2750, 4000) # min / max\nobjective <- dOverall(d_yield, d_viscosity, d_weight)\n\n\n\nNow, we can apply this objective function to predictions made by the three response surface fits we made above, in the section on overlaying contours. We’re evaluating the predictions over a grid of values in the range of the coded time and temperature.\n\n\ncoded <- as.data.frame(chem_coded)\nx_grid <- expand.grid(\n  time_coded = seq(min(coded$time_coded), max(coded$time_coded), .1),\n  temp_coded = seq(min(coded$temp_coded), max(coded$temp_coded), 0.1)\n)\n\n\n\n\n\ndesirabilities <- cbind(\n  x_grid,\n  y1 = predict(fits[[1]], x_grid),\n  y2 = predict(fits[[2]], x_grid),\n  y3 = predict(fits[[3]], x_grid)\n)\ny_hat <- desirabilities %>% \n  select(starts_with(\"y\"))\ndesirabilities$objective <- predict(objective, y_hat)\n\n\n\nAt this point, we can plot the desirability of each point in the time / temperature configuration space. Note that a second mode emerges along the low-temperature region – these are regions which have good viscosity and molecular weight properties, even though their yield isn’t as high. Try increasing the scale for yield to see what happens when you make the requirement for high yield more stringent.\n\n\nggplot(desirabilities) +\n  geom_tile(\n    aes(x = time_coded, y= temp_coded, fill = objective)\n  ) +\n  coord_fixed() +\n  scale_fill_viridis_c()\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Overall desirability, considering yield, viscosity, and molecular weight.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Sometimes we found the optimum just from one experiment, but more often, we ran a series of experiments, gradually refining our understanding of the response surface.\nFor any of these experiments, what designs should we use?\nIn theory, any of the designs we have discussed in this course could be used, but we will prefer those which give us an accurate estimate of the response surface (especially around stationary points) using as few samples as possible.\nDesigns for First-Order Models\nIn first-order models, we are interested in linear effects associated with each factor. Reasonable choices in this setting are,\n\\(2^{K}\\) factorial designs\n\\(2^{K - p}\\) fractional factorial designs\n\\(2^{K}\\) and \\(2^{K - p}\\) designs that have been augmented with center points. These center points allow estimation of measurement error \\(\\sigma^2\\) even when there is no replication.\nDesigns for Second-Order Models\nFor second-order models, we need to estimation nonlinear and interaction effects, which means we need more intensive sampling. The most common choice is the,\nCentral Composite Design (CCD): As discussed in Section 6.8, this is a full factorial \\(2^{K}\\) design that has been supplemented by center and axial points.\nthough some alternatives are,\nBox-Behnken design: The associated samples are all on edges of the cube (none at vertices or in the interior).\nEquiradial design: This generalizes the simplex idea above. Instead of sampling at the corners of an equilateral triangle, we can sample at corners or regular polygons (+ center points)\nIn practice, you can use functions from the rsm package. This code produces a central composite design with three center points for both the factorial and axial runs. The package also has code for factorial, fractional factorial, and Box-Behnken designs.\n\n\ncodings <- list(\n  time_coded ~ (time - 35) / 5,\n  temp_coded ~ (temp - 150) / 5\n)\nccd_design <- ccd(~ time_coded + temp_coded, coding = codings, oneblock = TRUE)\nhead(ccd_design)\n\n\n  run.order std.order     time     temp\n1         1         4 40.00000 155.0000\n2         2         8 35.00000 150.0000\n3         3         4 35.00000 157.0711\n4         4         6 35.00000 150.0000\n5         5         2 40.00000 145.0000\n6         6         2 42.07107 150.0000\n\nData are stored in coded form using these coding formulas ...\ntime_coded ~ (time - 35)/5\ntemp_coded ~ (temp - 150)/5\n\n\n\nggplot(decode.data(ccd_design)) +\n  geom_point(\n    aes(x = time, y = temp),\n    position = position_jitter(w = 0.5, h = 0.5),\n    size = 3\n  ) +\n  coord_fixed()\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: A generated CCD using the rsm package.\n\n\n\nUsing the same function, we can easily generate fractional or foldover designs, which are useful during the first-order phase of response surface modeling.

When we approach a potential optimum, we will switch to second-order models.\n\n\n\nWhen we last discussed response surfaces (in Chapter 5), we showed how to fit a regression surface to a fixed set of runs. This let us find configurations of factors that optimized some response of interest.\nHowever, the real power of response surfaces emerges when we think sequentially, using the results from one fit to plan a series of follow-up experiments, each bringing us closer to an optimal configuration of factors.\nFirst and Second-Order Models\nIt makes sense to gradually refine our designs as we approach a potential optimal point. At the start of experimentation, even a few small runs are likely to point us in the right direction. Near the end, we’ll want to tune a good configuration of factors into an optimal one.\nOne approach is to divide experimentation into two phases. We can start with first-order models, and then proceed to second-order when in the vicinity of the optimum.\nA first-order model is a linear model without any interactions or nonlinearities. It can be fit using relatively few samples; for example, unreplicated or fractional factorial designs. It is defined as, \\[\\begin{align*}\ny_{i} &= \\beta_{0} + \\sum_{k = 1}^{K}\\beta_{k}x_{ik} + \\epsilon_{i} \\\\\n&= x_{i}^{T}b + \\epsilon_{i}\n\\end{align*}\\]\nwhere we defined \\[\\begin{align*}\nx_{i} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\\nx_{i1} \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\nx_{iK}\n\\end{pmatrix},\n\\end{align*}\\] and \\[\\begin{align*}\nb = \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\beta_0 \\\\\n\\beta_1 \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\n\\beta_{K}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\end{align*}\\]\nA second-order model is a linear model with interactions and quadratic terms. These surfaces are more complex, so require more involved sampling, like replicated factorial or central composite designs. It is defined as, \\[\\begin{align*}\ny_{i} &= \\beta_0 + \\sum_{k = 1}^{K}\\beta_{kk}x_{k}^{2} + \\sum_{k < k_{\\prime}} \\beta_{k k^{\\prime}} x_{k}x_{k^{\\prime}} + \\epsilon_{i} \\\\\n&= x_{i}^{T}b + x_{i}^{T} B x_i + \\epsilon_{i}\n\\end{align*}\\]\nwhere we defined \\(B\\) as the symmetric \\(K \\times K\\) matrix with diagonal entries \\(\\beta_{kk}\\) and off-diagonal elements \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\beta_{kl} = \\frac{1}{2}\\beta_{lk}\\).\nMethod of Steepest Ascent\nThe method of steepest ascent uses the results of a first-order model to propose a new configuration of factors that brings us closer to the optimum. Specifically, we use the following recipe,\nUsing the current set of sampled factor configurations, fit the first-order (linear) surface, \\[\\begin{align*}\n\\hat{y}\\left(x\\right) &= x^{T}\\hat{b}\n\\end{align*}\\]\nFind the coordinate \\(k^{\\ast}\\) of the coefficient that has the largest magnitude, \\[\\begin{align*}\n k^{\\ast} &= \\arg \\max_{k \\in \\{1, \\dots, K\\}} \\left|\\hat{\\beta}_{k}\\right|\n\\end{align*}\\]\nwhich represents the factor to which the response is most sensitive. Define some reasonable stepsize \\(\\Delta x_{k^{\\ast}}\\) for this particular factor, so that the next run brings us closer to the optimum without being so far that the first-order model may not hold.\nUpdate each factor’s sampling values according to the sensitivities \\(\\hat{\\beta_{k}}\\) of the response to that factor, and adjusting for the stepsize defined in step (2). \\[\\begin{align*}\nx \\leftarrow x + \\frac{\\Delta x_{k^{\\ast}}}{\\beta_{k^{\\ast}}} b\n\\end{align*}\\]\nCode Example\nLet’s work through example 11.1. Here, an experimenter is trying to optimize yield as a function of reaction time and temperature. The current time / temperature setting is at 35 minutes and 155 degrees. A \\(2^{2}\\) factorial is run with four center points. Let’s visualize the data.\n\n\nchem <- read_csv(\"https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/4x9v5wtgu8w8i2kuzjdhtlhkj1tda701.csv\") %>%\n  group_split(seq) # split main from follow-up experiments\n\n\n\n\n\np <- ggplot(chem[[1]]) +\n  geom_point(\n    aes(x = time, y = temp, col = yield),\n    position = position_jitter(w = 0.5, h = 0.5),\n    size = 3\n  ) +\n  coord_fixed() +\n  scale_color_viridis_c()\np\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: \\(2^2\\) factorial experiment around current operating conditions.\n\n\n\nLet’s code the data – this is a bit more involved than in factorial experiments, because the data don’t simply lie on the corners of a cube.

There are two essential issues,\nWe need a way of deciding whether a point is optimal. The method of steepest ascent will always report a new direction to explore, even if the benefit is marginal. At some point we need to stop.\nWe need a better way of proposing new directions to explore, when the first-order model is insufficient. Since the method of steepest ascent relies on a first-order model, it will not give good directions when the surface is actually highly nonlinear.\nCanonical analysis helps solve both of these problems. First, we’ll define canonical analysis, and then we’ll illustrate its use in finding optimal points and proposing new directions.\nMathematical Setup\nA first-order model never has any isolated optima. It’s either perfectly flat, or increases forever in some direction. A second-order model, however, does potentially have optimal values.\nCalculus can help us identify these optima. Recall that, at a function’s maximum, its gradient is zero. This makes it natural to consider the gradient of a fitted second order surface, \\[\\begin{align*}\n\\nabla_{x}\\hat{y}\\left(x\\right) &= \\nabla_{x}\\left[x^{T}\\hat{b} + x^{T}\\hat{B}x\\right] \\\\\n&= \\hat{b} + 2\\hat{B}x\n\\end{align*}\\]\nso the function has a stationary point at \\[\\begin{align*}\nx_{\\ast} &= -\\frac{1}{2}\\hat{B}^{-1}\\hat{b}.\n\\end{align*}\\]\nWe’ll denote the value of the surface at this optimal point by \\[\\begin{align*}\n\\hat{y}_{\\ast} &= \\hat{b}^{T}x + x^{T}\\hat{B}\\hat{x} \\\\\n&= -\\frac{1}{2}\\hat{b}^{T}\\hat{B}^{-1}\\hat{b} + \\frac{1}{4}\\hat{b}^{T} \\hat{B}^{-1} \\hat{B} \\hat{B}^{-1} \\hat{b} \\\\\n&= -\\frac{1}{4}\\hat{b}^{T}\\hat{B}^{-1}\\hat{b}\n\\end{align*}\\]\nJust like in ordinary calculus, there are three possibilities,\nThe stationary point is a maximum\nThe stationary point is a minimum\nThe stationary point is a saddlepoint\nIn one-variable calculus, we’d just take second derivatives, and see whether the function curves up, down, or is flat. We’re in higher-dimensions, though, so we’ll use the generalization of the second-derivative test, called…\nCanonical Representation\n\n\ndisplay(readImage(\"https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/ngiy01l2mtvem1o9e6diwawhypgf3jst.png\"))\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Geometric representation of the eigendecomposition.\n\n\n\nSince \\(\\hat{B}\\) is symmetric, we can find an eigendecomposition, \\[\\begin{align*}\n\\hat{B} &= U \\Lambda U^{T},\n\\end{align*}\\]\nwhere \\(U\\) are orthogonal eigenvectors and \\(\\Lambda\\) is a diagonal matrix containing eigenvalues \\(\\lambda_{k}\\). Define \\(w\\left(x\\right) = U^{T}\\left(x - x_{\\ast}\\right)\\). It turns out that our second-order fit can be equivalently expressed as \\[\\begin{align*}\n\\hat{y}\\left(x\\right) &= \\hat{y}_{\\ast} + w^T\\left(x\\right)\\Lambda w\\left(x\\right) \\\\\n&= \\hat{y}_{\\ast} + \\sum_{k = 1}^{K} \\lambda_{k}w^{2}_{k}\\left(x\\right)\n\\end{align*}\\]\nwhich is much simpler because there are no interaction terms between the \\(w_{k}\\)’s (like there are between \\(x_{k}\\)’s).\nProof1: The textbook skips the proof of this fact, but if you have seen some linear algebra, the approach is interesting. First, plug-in the value of \\(\\hat{y}_{\\ast}\\) from above, and expand the definition of \\(w\\left(x\\right)\\), \\[\\begin{align*}\n\\hat{y}\\left(x\\right) &= \\hat{y}_{\\ast} + w^{T}\\left(x\\right) \\Lambda w\\left(x\\right) \\\\\n&= -\\frac{1}{4}\\hat{b}^{T}\\hat{B}\\hat{b} + \\left(x - x_{\\ast}\\right)^{T}U\\Lambda U^{T} \\left(x - x_{\\ast}\\right).\n\\end{align*}\\]\nNow, use the definition of our original eigendecomposition \\(\\hat{B} = U \\Lambda U^{T}\\) and expand the quadratic, \\[\\begin{align*}\n\\hat{y}\\left(x\\right) &= -\\frac{1}{4}\\hat{b}^{T}\\hat{B}\\hat{b} + \\left(x - x_{\\ast}\\right)^{T}\\hat{B}\\left(x - x_{\\ast}\\right) \\\\\n&= -\\frac{1}{4}\\hat{b}^{T}\\hat{B}\\hat{b} + x^{T}\\hat{B}x - 2x^{T}\\hat{B}x_{\\ast} + x^{T}_{\\ast}\\hat{B}x_{\\ast}.\n\\end{align*}\\]\nTo simplify, let’s plug-in the expression for the stationary point \\(x_{\\ast} = -\\frac{1}{2}\\hat{B}^{-1}\\hat{b}\\) that we found above, \\[\\begin{align*}\n\\hat{y}\\left(x\\right) &= -\\frac{1}{4}\\hat{b}^{T}\\hat{B}\\hat{b} + x^{T}\\hat{B}x + x^{T}\\hat{B}\\hat{B}^{-1}\\hat{b} + \\frac{1}{4}\\hat{b}^{T}\\hat{B}^{-1}\\hat{B}\\hat{B}^{-1}\\hat{b} \\\\\n&= \\hat{b}^{T}x + x^{T}\\hat{B}x\n\\end{align*}\\]\nwhich was exactly our original definition of the second-order model.\nImplications\nThe representation of the second-order model by \\[\\begin{align}\n\\label{eq:canonical}\n\\hat{y}\\left(x\\right) &= \\hat{y}_{\\ast} + \\sum_{k = 1}^{K} \\lambda_{k}w^{2}_{k}\\left(x\\right)\n\\end{align}\\]\nis an important one, because\nIt provides the high-dimensional analog of the second-derivative test.\nIt suggests new configurations of \\(x\\) that might be better.\nTo see 1., suppose the \\(\\lambda_{k}\\)’s were all negative. Then, expression  is maximized when \\(w_{k}\\left(x\\right)\\) are all zero — any change in the \\(w_{k}\\left(x\\right)\\)’s from there can only ever decrease \\(\\hat{y}\\left(x\\right)\\).\nBut \\(w\\left(x\\right) = 0\\) happens at \\(x = x_{\\ast}\\), by definition of \\(w\\left(x\\right)\\).\nThis means \\(x_{\\ast}\\) is a maximum!\nSimilarly, when all \\(\\lambda_{k}\\) are all positive, then moving the \\(w_{k}\\left(x\\right)\\)’s by any amount can only increase \\(\\hat{y}\\left(x\\right)\\). This means we’re at a minimum!\nFinally, when some of the \\(\\lambda_{k}\\)’s are positive and others are negative, then we’re at a saddlepoint.\nIncreasing \\(w_{k}\\left(x\\right)\\) for \\(\\lambda_{k}\\)’s that are positive will increase \\(\\hat{y}\\left(x\\right)\\).\nIncreasing \\(w_{k}\\left(x\\right)\\) for \\(\\lambda_{k}\\)’s that are negative will decrease \\(\\hat{y}\\left(x\\right)\\).\nThis last discussion also gives us insight into 2.\nTo find configurations \\(x\\) that further increase the value of the response surface \\(\\hat{y}\\left(x\\right)\\), increase \\(w_{k}\\left(x\\right)\\) for those \\(k\\)’s where \\(\\lambda_{k}\\) is most positive.\nData Example\nWe’ll continue the chemical process experiment from last time. Here, the experimenter has performed a central composite design experiment, a refinement of the earlier factorial designs. The hope is that now a configuration that maximizes the yield can be precisely isolated.\n\n\nchem <- read_csv(\"https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/nbaj1m8j7tuaqmznjlrsgbzyhp9k61i8.csv\")\nggplot(chem) +\n  geom_point(\n    aes(x = time, y = temp, col = yield),\n    position = position_jitter(w = 0.3, h = 0.3)\n  ) +\n  coord_fixed() +\n  scale_color_viridis_c()\n\n\n\n\nAs before, we will code the data. We use SO to fit a second-order model. It appears that the linear and pure quadratic components are very strong, and that there is limited, if any, interaction between these two variables.\n\n\nchem_coded <- coded.data(chem, time_coded ~ (time - 35) / 5, temp_coded ~ (temp - 155) / 5)\nfit <- rsm(yield ~ SO(temp_coded, time_coded), data = chem_coded)\nanova(fit)\n\n\nAnalysis of Variance Table\n\nResponse: yield\n                            Df  Sum Sq Mean Sq  F value    Pr(>F)    \nFO(temp_coded, time_coded)   2 10.0430  5.0215  70.8143 2.267e-05 ***\nTWI(temp_coded, time_coded)  1  0.2500  0.2500   3.5256    0.1025    \nPQ(temp_coded, time_coded)   2 17.9537  8.9769 126.5944 3.194e-06 ***\nResiduals                    7  0.4964  0.0709                       \n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\nNext, we can perform a canonical analysis, to make sure that we are at a stationary point. Since both of the eigenvalues are negative, this is in fact the case. The eigenvectors also tell us directions that (in this case) decrease the yield fastest.\n\n\nanalysis <- canonical(fit)\nanalysis\n\n\n$xs\ntemp_coded time_coded \n  4.305847  10.389230 \n\n$eigen\neigen() decomposition\n$values\n[1] -0.9634986 -1.4142867\n\n$vectors\n                 [,1]       [,2]\ntemp_coded -0.9571122 -0.2897174\ntime_coded -0.2897174  0.9571122\n\nWe can identify the specific location of the optimum, by decoding the canonical analysis.\n\n\nstationary <- code2val(analysis$xs, codings = codings(chem_coded))\nstationary\n\n\n     temp      time \n176.52923  86.94615 \n\n\n\nw1 <- code2val(analysis$xs + analysis$eigen$vectors[, 1], codings = codings(chem_coded))\nw2 <- code2val(analysis$xs + analysis$eigen$vectors[, 2], codings = codings(chem_coded))\n\n\n\nFinally, let’s plot the response surface, with the canonical points overlaid.\n\n\ncontour(fit, ~ time_coded + temp_coded, image = TRUE, asp = 1)\nsegments(stationary[2], stationary[1], w1[2], w1[1], col = \"red\")\nsegments(stationary[2], stationary[1], w2[2], w2[1], col = \"red\")\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: The response surface, with canonical vectors overlaid.\n\n\n\n\nYou can skip this proof without worrying whether it will appear in later lectures or assignments / exams.

However, there are specific ways to follow-up initial experiments in a way that dealiases these effects.\nBest case: The hierarchical and hereditary principles allow strong effects to be isolated using only a \\(\\frac{1}{2^p}\\) fraction of the samples needed for the full design.\nWorst case: Strong effects remain aliased, and a follow-up dealiasing experiment is required.\nWe’ll discuss two dealiasing strategies, full-foldover and single-factor foldover. They are both particularly relevant in resolution III designs, where main effects can be confounded with order-2 interactions.\nFull Foldover\n\n\neye <- read_table2(\"https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/zh7majh2s6gesnu6f27fl17ncqfuwzev.txt\") %>%\n  mutate_at(vars(-Seq, -y), code)\n\n\n\n\n\nmdesign <- eye %>%\n  mutate(ix = row_number()) %>%\n  select(-y) %>%\n  melt(id.vars = c(\"ix\", \"Seq\"))\nggplot(mdesign) +\n  geom_tile(aes(x = variable, y = as.factor(ix), fill = as.factor(value))) +\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Set3\") +\n  facet_grid(Seq ~ ., scale = \"free_y\") +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Setup for the \\(2^{7 - 4}\\) design with foldover used in the eye focus experiment. The second panel is the full foldover of the first.\n\n\n\nUse case: We want to delias main effects for all factors under study\nAssume that there aren’t any interaction effects with order > 2\n\nIdea: For a second fractional factorial run, reverse the signs of all factors\nWhat does this do? Let’s consider an the eye focus time example from the textbook (Example 8.7). The design is a \\(2^{7 - 3}_{III}\\) fractional factorial experiment (Seq == 1) that has then been folded over (Seq == 2) by reversing the signs of factors.\nLet’s consider the alias structure for the original fractional factorial, ignoring all interactions of order 3 and higher.\n\n\nfit <- lm(y ~ A * B * C * D * E * F * G, data = eye[eye$Seq == 1, ])\nplot_aliases(fit, 29)\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Alias pattern of the original \\(2^{7 - 3}\\) design.\n\n\n\nParsing this matrix, the effects derived from alias groups are \\[\\begin{align*}\n[A] = A + BD + CE + FG \\\\\n[B] = B + AD + CF + EG \\\\\n[C] = C + AE + BF + DG \\\\\n[D] = D + AB + CG + EF \\\\\n[E] = E + AC + BG + DF \\\\\n[F] = F + BC + BG + DE \\\\\n[G] = G + CD + BE + AF\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\n\nfit <- lm(y ~ A * B * C * D * E * F * G, data = eye[eye$Seq == 2, ])\nplot_aliases(fit, 29)\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Alias pattern after a full foldover. Note that the signs between main effects and their aliased interactions have switched.\n\n\n\nNow, suppose we reversed the signs of all the factors. What happens to the alias groups? The signs for the second order interactions flip! The resulting effect estimates are \\[\\begin{align*}\n[A]^{fold} = A - BD - CE - FG \\\\\n[B]^{fold} = B - AD - CF - EG \\\\\n[C]^{fold} = C - AE - BF - DG \\\\\n[D]^{fold} = D - AB - CG - EF \\\\\n[E]^{fold} = E - AC - BG - DF \\\\\n[F]^{fold} = F - BC - BG - DE \\\\\n[G]^{fold} = G - CD - BE - AF\n\\end{align*}\\]\nThe punchline is that we can now estimate the main effects without any aliasing, \\[\\begin{align*}\nA = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\left[A\\right] + \\left[A\\right]^{fold}\\right) \\\\\nB = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\left[B\\right] + \\left[B\\right]^{fold}\\right) \\\\\nC = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\left[C\\right] + \\left[C\\right]^{fold}\\right) \\\\\nD = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\left[D\\right] + \\left[D\\right]^{fold}\\right) \\\\\nE = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\left[E\\right] + \\left[E\\right]^{fold}\\right) \\\\\nF = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\left[F\\right] + \\left[F\\right]^{fold}\\right) \\\\\nG = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\left[G\\right] + \\left[G\\right]^{fold}\\right) \\\\\n\\end{align*}\\]\nThis is in fact a general principle for dealising main effects from second order interactions. When you flip the signs of all factors in an original fractional factorial design, you will get a cancellation of second-order terms when you add pairs of effect estimates.\nData Example\nLet’s use these ideas to study effects in the eye data experiment. Let’s first make a Daniel plot of the effects we’d find when running the fractional factorial before foldover.\n\n\neye1 <- eye[eye$Seq == 1, ]\nfit <- lm(y ~ A * B * C * D * E * F, data = eye1)\neffects <- coef(fit)[-1]\ndaniel_plot(effects, probs = c(0.1, 0.5))\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: From the original fraction, it seems that the effects for [A], [B], and [D] are important.\n\n\n\nIt seems like \\(\\left[B\\right], \\left[D\\right]\\), and / or \\(\\left[A\\right]\\) are important. Inspecting the corresponding alias groups, and using the heredity principle, some plausible situations are\n\\(A, B, D\\) are important\n\\(A, B, AB\\) are important\n\\(A, D, AD\\) are important\n\\(B, D, BD\\) are important\nBut without more information, we can’t draw further conclusions. To that end, suppose we’ve run the full foldover experiment. Let’s estimate effects in this run and then add them to effects from before – this is how we can estimate the main effects.\n\n\nfit <- lm(y ~ A * B * C * D * E * F, data = eye[eye$Seq == 2, ])\neffects_fold <- coef(fit)[-1]\n(effects + effects_fold)[1:6]\n\n\n     A      B      C      D      E      F \n 1.475 38.050 -1.800 29.375  0.125  0.500 \n\nIt’s now clear that the main effect for \\(A\\) is in fact not important. The only plausible situation is that \\(B, D\\) and the \\(BD\\) interaction are strong.\nSingle-Factor Foldover\nUse case: We want to dealias main and interaction effects associated with a single factor in the study\nIdea: For a second fractional factorial run, reverse the signs of just the factor of interest.\nThe mechanics at work here are similar to those in the full foldover. As before, let’s focus attention on the \\(2^{7 - 3}_{III}\\). Remember that the effect estimates were, \\[\\begin{align*}\n[A] = A + BD + CE + FG \\\\\n[B] = B + AD + CF + EG \\\\\n[C] = C + AE + BF + DG \\\\\n[D] = D + AB + CG + EF \\\\\n[E] = E + AC + BG + DF \\\\\n[F] = F + BC + BG + DE \\\\\n[G] = G + CD + BE + AF\n\\end{align*}\\]\nSuppose we flip the sign of factor \\(D\\) in the follow-up run. The new effect estimates would be, \\[\\begin{align*}\n[A]^{fold} &= A - BD + CE + FG \\\\\n[B]^{fold} &= B - AD + CF + EG \\\\\n[C]^{fold} &= C + AE + BF + DG \\\\\n[D]^{fold} &= -D + AB + CG + EF \\\\\n[E]^{fold} &= E + AC + BG - DF \\\\\n[F]^{fold} &= F + BC + BG - DE \\\\\n[G]^{fold} &= G - CD + BE + AF\n\\end{align*}\\]\nYou can see this in the plot — all the signs from terms involving \\(D\\) are flipped.\nIn particular, notice that we can estimate the main effect of \\(D\\) using \\[\\begin{align*}\nD = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\left[D\\right] - \\left[D\\right]^{fold}\\right)\n\\end{align*}\\]\nand interactions involving \\(D\\) using, for example, \\[\\begin{align*}\nAD = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\left[B\\right] - \\left[B\\right]^{fold}\\right).\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\n\n\n",

Two-way interactions are confounded with one another, but not with any main effects.\nFor an exercise, you can try going through this process using an alternative confounding structure: Set \\(E = ABCD\\), and \\(F = ABC\\).

Is it a fractional or full factorial? How many replicates each?

But, we still have to break the runs into batches, we have too many runs to be able to reasonably run them in one block. How can we appropriately block a fractional factorial design?\nThe typical solution is to choose a high-order effect and alias it with the batches. This divides the runs into two blocks, those where the effect is + and those where it is -.\nEnsure that the alias group doesn’t contain any low-order effects of interest (e.g., we don’t want the blocks to be confounded with any main effects)\nWe effectively sacrifice the alias group that is confounded with the block.\nExample: For our \\(2 ^{6 - 2}\\) design above, we can confound \\(ACD\\) with the block, to avoid aliasing any main effects with the block effect.

This is an extremely efficient use of samples.\nThe reason we don’t use saturated designs all the time are that (1) they are not available for all choices of \\(K\\) and (2) the resulting aliasing structure can make definitive inferences difficult. That said, it’s worth being familiar with a few saturated designs, since it can result in dramatically reduced sampling effort in some special cases.\nResolution III Designs\nWhen \\(K + 1\\) is a power of 2, then there are resolution III designs that use only \\(N = K + 1\\) samples.\nExamples\n\\(2^{3 - 1}_{III}\\): 3 factors in 4 samples\nGenerators: \\(C = AB\\)\n\nA\nB\nC\n-\n-\n+\n-\n+\n-\n+\n-\n-\n+\n+\n+\n\\(2^{7 - 4}_{III}\\): 7 factors in 8 samples\nGenerators: \\(D = AB, E = AC, F = BC, G = ABC\\)\nSee Table VIII(h) for alias groups.\n\n\\(2^{15 - 11}_{III}\\): 15 factors in 16 samples\nSee Table VII(h) for generators and alias groups (there are many)\n\nExercise: Give another example (e.g., for 31 factors?)\nPlackett-Burman Designs\nPlackett-Burman designs are a collection of design options working outside the usual fractional factorial paradigm — they don’t rely on the ideas of generators or defining relations that we’ve been using so far to subset full factorial designs into less-costly experiments.\nWe won’t describe their construction, which relies on techniques from abstract algebra. The properties that are most important to know are\nA saturated design can be found whenever \\(K + 1\\) is a multiple of 4, which is much more often than in the resolution III situation above\nTheir aliasing structure is typically more complicated. For example, when \\(K = 11\\), then every main effect is aliased with every pairwise interaction not including that main effect\nTheir projectivity properties are typically good.\nE.g., resolution III Plackett-Burman has projectivity 3, while any \\(2^{k -  p}_{III}\\) fractional factorial has only projectivity 2\nSo, we can collapse to any subset of 3 factors and get a full factorial\n\nTo use these designs, you have to look up the tables of +/-’s, saying which factors to keep on or off for each run.

We can add quadratic terms to our model and perform ANOVA on the associated term.

The differences between 4 and 7 factors doesn’t sound like a lot, but it’s the difference between 16 and 128 experimental runs. Fractional factorial designs show how to study extra factors without having to make as many runs. There is no free lunch, but the tradeoffs that it creates are often worth it.\nPrinciples\nThere are two central ideas,\nSparsity of Effects: It’s often safe to assume that high-order interactions are rare.\nHeredity: It is unusual for an interaction to be significant without the corresponding main effects also being significant. For example, it would be unusual to have \\(A \\times B\\) be significant without at least one of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) being significant.\nInitial Exploration\n\n\ndisplay(readImage(\"https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/gu87vet64i970eonsbvtds7bsb31qbuy.png\"))\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: A bad choice of samples to subset down to, which would make it impossible to estimate effects from \\(C\\).\n\n\n\nSuppose we want to study \\(A, B\\) and \\(C\\), but we only have a budget of 4 runs. We need to choose four corners of the cube to sample. Some choices are obviously bad. E.g., if we chose all the samples on one face, we wouldn’t see any variation in one factor. Here’s an idea that will lead us on the right path. Recall our old notation,\nlabel\nA\nB\nAB\n(1)\n-\n-\n+\na\n+\n-\n-\nb\n-\n+\n-\nab\n+\n+\n+\nActing on the sparsity of effects principle, let’s suppose that AB is null and invent a contrast for C that exactly matches AB.

This turns out to be a general strategy for subsetting the full design. But before we do another example, we need to define some vocabulary.\nVocabulary\n\\(2^{K - 1}\\): This denotes a fractional factorial design where we take \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) of the samples in a \\(2^{K}\\) design.\nAliases: Above, we assumed that AB was null. Suppose that it weren’t, though. Notice that the contrasts used for the pairs below are all equal, \\[\\begin{align*}\n   \\left[AB\\right] &= \\frac{1}{2}\\left(c - a + b + abc\\right) = \\left[C\\right] \\\\\n      \\left[BC\\right] &= \\frac{1}{2}\\left(-c + a - b + abc\\right) = \\left[A\\right] \\\\\n      \\left[AC\\right] &= \\frac{1}{2}\\left(-c - a + b + abc\\right) = \\left[B\\right]\n\\end{align*}\\]\nand we have no conclusive way of distinguishing between these aliased effects, besides appeals to the hereditary principle or domain knowledge. To denote this unidentifiability, we will use bracket notation, for example, \\[\\begin{align*}\n\\left[A\\right] &= A + BC.\n\\end{align*}\\]\nGenerators: In the example, we set \\(C = AB\\). Multiplying both sides by \\(C\\) and using the fact that \\(C^2 = I\\), we find \\(ABC = I\\).

Often, if there are strong aliased effects in an initial fractional design, the complementary fraction will be run in the next experiment.\nResolution: A fractional design has resolution \\(R\\) if no \\(p\\)-factor is aliased with an effect containing less than \\(R - p\\) factors.\n\\(R\\)\n\\(p\\)\n\\(< R - p\\)\nInterpretation\n3\n1\n\\(\\leq 2\\)\nMain effects aren’t aliased with other main effects, but could be aliased with two-way interactions\n4\n1\n\\(\\leq 3\\)\nMain effects aren’t aliased with any other main effects or with any two-way interactions, but could be aliased with three-way interactions\n\n2\n\\(\\leq 2\\)\nTwo-way interactions aren’t aliased with main effects.\n5\n1\n\\(\\leq 4\\)\nMain effects aren’t aliased with other main effects, two-way, or three way interactions.\n\n2\n\\(\\leq 3\\)\nTwo-way interactions aren’t aliased with with main effects or two-way interactions.\nProjection: In a fractional factorial, if we decided that we don’t care about a factor after all, we automatically end up with a \\(2 ^ {K - 1}\\) full-factorial for free.\n\n\ndisplay(readImage(\"https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/b94hfeyugeun1xywlm2ccls9am5l38xg.jpg\"))\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Three projections of \\(2^3\\) designs into \\(2^2\\) designs, from the textbook.\n\n\n\n\nSequences: If we find a strong contrast for an aliased effect, it’s natural to try a follow-up experiment to resolve the ambiguity.\nCode Example\nLet’s suppose we only had only run half of the runs in the filtration example from week 9 [1]. The original experiment is a \\(2^ 4\\) design; we will choose the fraction corresponding to the word1 \\(I = ABCD\\)\nThis is a general principle for \\(2 ^ {K - 1}\\) designs: choose which configurations to run by defining the relation \\(K = A B C \\dots J\\). This turns a full \\(2^{K - 1}\\) factorial design, which only studied \\(K - 1\\) factors into a fractional \\(2^{K - 1}\\) factorial that studies \\(K\\) factors.\n\n\n\nWe can perform the fit.

Why does this work? In these notes, we’ll see how our effect estimates can be viewed through the lens of linear regression.\nThe Design Matrix\nLet’s write our contrasts summary table linear algebraically. Remember our notation,\nA\nB\nC\nAB\nlabel\n-\n-\n-\n+\n(1)\n+\n-\n-\n-\na\n-\n+\n-\n-\nb\n-\n-\n+\n+\nc\n+\n+\n-\n+\nab\n+\n-\n+\n-\nac\n-\n+\n+\n-\nbc\n+\n+\n+\n+\nabc\nWe’ll translate this into\n\\[\\begin{align*}\nX &= \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & -1 & -1 & - 1 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 1 & -1 & -1 & -1 \\\\\n1 & -1 & 1 & -1 & -1 \\\\\n1 & -1 & -1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 1 & -1 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 1 & -1 & 1 & -1 \\\\\n1 & -1 & 1 & 1 & -1 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix} \\\\\n\\end{align*}\\] \\[\\begin{align*}\ny &= \\begin{pmatrix}\n(1) \\\\\na \\\\\nb \\\\\nc \\\\\nab \\\\\nac \\\\\nbc \\\\\nabc\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\end{align*}\\]\nFor \\(X\\), we’ve just added an intercept column of \\(1\\)’s and concatenated it with the contrasts written as \\(\\pm 1\\)’s. As before, \\((1)\\) means the value of the sample taken at that corner of the cube, \\(a\\) means the sample at the \\(a\\) corner, etc.\n\n\ndisplay(readImage(\"https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/8euuywv5ay4x7przznhsxdo269865h2a.png\"))\n\n\n\n\nLet’s observe some properties of this matrix,\nIt has \\(2^{K}\\) rows, one per replicate on each corner of the cube.\nIt has \\(2^{K}\\) columns. To see why, notice that there are\n1 intercept, \\(K\\) main effects, and \\({K \\choose 2}\\) two-way interactions, which adds up to \\(2 ^ K\\).\nMoreover, if our \\(K > 2\\), we’d have \\({K \\choose 3}\\) three-way interactions, etc. and that, by the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^{K} = \\sum_{j \\leq  K} {K \\choose j}1^{j}1^{K - j}\\)\n\nThe columns are orthogonal. Their norms are all \\(2^{K}\\). Hence \\(X^{T}X = 2^{K}I_{2^{K}}\\).\n\\(\\hat{\\beta}\\) and Effect Estimates\nIn linear regression, the least squares solution \\(\\hat{\\beta}\\) is the vector that optimizes\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n\\hat{beta} := \\arg\\min_{\\beta \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2^{K}}} \\|y - X\\beta\\|_{2}^{2}\n\\end{align*}\\]\nTo minimize a quadratic like this, we can differentiate and use the chain rule,\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\beta}\\left[\\|y - X\\beta\\|_{2}^{2}\\right] &= 0 \\\\\n\\iff 2X^{T}\\left(y - X\\beta\\right) &= 0\n\\end{align*}\\]\nwhich implies that \\(\\hat{\\beta} = \\left(X^{T}X\\right)^{-1}X^{T}y\\). However, by the observations above, this means,\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n\\hat{\\beta} &= \\left(2^{K}I_{2^{K}}\\right)^{-1}X^T y \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{2^{K}}X^{T}y.\n\\end{align*}\\]\nBut \\(X^{T}y\\) are exactly our contrasts (!),\n\\[\\begin{align*}\nX^{T}y &= \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 &  1 &  1 &  1 & 1 & 1 &  1 & 1 \\\\\n-1 & 1 & -1 & -1 & 1 & 1 & -1 & 1 \\\\\n-1 & -1 & 1 & -1 & 1 & -1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n\\vdots & & & & & & & \\vdots\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\left(1\\right) \\\\\na \\\\\nb \\\\\nc \\\\\n\\vdots \n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\end{align*}\\]\ne.g., \\(A = \\frac{1}{2^{K - 1}}\\left[-(1) + a - b -c + ab + ac - bc + abc\\right]\\). The only difference between \\(\\hat{\\beta}\\) and our effect estimates is a factor of 2 in the scaling. Therefore, to estimate the effects in a \\(2^{K}\\) design, it’s enough to construct the \\(X, y\\) matrices above and plug them into standard linear regression programs.\nCode Example\nTo complete this discussion, let’s revisit the \\(2 ^ 4\\) design in the drill example. First, let’s verify that the \\(X\\) matrix used by lm is the same as the one in our conceptual discussion.\n\n\ncode <- function(x) ifelse(x == '-', -1, 1)\ndrill <- read_csv(\"https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/7l8bpcu36a12a8c0chlh4id0qezdnnoe.csv\") %>%\n  mutate_at(vars(-rate), code)\nfit <- lm(rate ~ A * B * C * D, drill)\nX <- model.matrix(fit)\nX\n\n\n   (Intercept)  A  B  C  D A:B A:C B:C A:D B:D C:D A:B:C A:B:D A:C:D\n1            1 -1 -1 -1 -1   1   1   1   1   1   1    -1    -1    -1\n2            1  1 -1 -1 -1  -1  -1   1  -1   1   1     1     1     1\n3            1 -1  1 -1 -1  -1   1  -1   1  -1   1     1     1    -1\n4            1 -1 -1  1 -1   1  -1  -1   1   1  -1     1    -1     1\n5            1 -1 -1 -1  1   1   1   1  -1  -1  -1    -1     1     1\n6            1  1  1 -1 -1   1  -1  -1  -1  -1   1    -1    -1     1\n7            1  1 -1  1 -1  -1   1  -1  -1   1  -1    -1     1    -1\n8            1  1 -1 -1  1  -1  -1   1   1  -1  -1     1    -1    -1\n9            1 -1  1  1 -1  -1  -1   1   1  -1  -1    -1     1     1\n10           1 -1  1 -1  1  -1   1  -1  -1   1  -1     1    -1     1\n11           1 -1 -1  1  1   1  -1  -1  -1  -1   1     1     1    -1\n12           1  1  1  1 -1   1   1   1  -1  -1  -1     1    -1    -1\n13           1  1 -1  1  1  -1   1  -1   1  -1   1    -1    -1     1\n14           1  1  1 -1  1   1  -1  -1   1   1  -1    -1     1    -1\n15           1 -1  1  1  1  -1  -1   1  -1   1   1    -1    -1    -1\n16           1  1  1  1  1   1   1   1   1   1   1     1     1     1\n   B:C:D A:B:C:D\n1     -1       1\n2     -1      -1\n3      1      -1\n4      1      -1\n5      1      -1\n6      1       1\n7      1       1\n8      1       1\n9     -1       1\n10    -1       1\n11    -1       1\n12    -1      -1\n13    -1      -1\n14    -1      -1\n15     1      -1\n16     1       1\nattr(,\"assign\")\n [1]  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15\n\nWe can also check the dimension and orthogonality of this matrix.\n\n\ndim(X)\n\n\n[1] 16 16\n\nt(X) %*% X\n\n\n            (Intercept)  A  B  C  D A:B A:C B:C A:D B:D C:D A:B:C\n(Intercept)          16  0  0  0  0   0   0   0   0   0   0     0\nA                     0 16  0  0  0   0   0   0   0   0   0     0\nB                     0  0 16  0  0   0   0   0   0   0   0     0\nC                     0  0  0 16  0   0   0   0   0   0   0     0\nD                     0  0  0  0 16   0   0   0   0   0   0     0\nA:B                   0  0  0  0  0  16   0   0   0   0   0     0\nA:C                   0  0  0  0  0   0  16   0   0   0   0     0\nB:C                   0  0  0  0  0   0   0  16   0   0   0     0\nA:D                   0  0  0  0  0   0   0   0  16   0   0     0\nB:D                   0  0  0  0  0   0   0   0   0  16   0     0\nC:D                   0  0  0  0  0   0   0   0   0   0  16     0\nA:B:C                 0  0  0  0  0   0   0   0   0   0   0    16\nA:B:D                 0  0  0  0  0   0   0   0   0   0   0     0\nA:C:D                 0  0  0  0  0   0   0   0   0   0   0     0\nB:C:D                 0  0  0  0  0   0   0   0   0   0   0     0\nA:B:C:D               0  0  0  0  0   0   0   0   0   0   0     0\n            A:B:D A:C:D B:C:D A:B:C:D\n(Intercept)     0     0     0       0\nA               0     0     0       0\nB               0     0     0       0\nC               0     0     0       0\nD               0     0     0       0\nA:B             0     0     0       0\nA:C             0     0     0       0\nB:C             0     0     0       0\nA:D             0     0     0       0\nB:D             0     0     0       0\nC:D             0     0     0       0\nA:B:C           0     0     0       0\nA:B:D          16     0     0       0\nA:C:D           0    16     0       0\nB:C:D           0     0    16       0\nA:B:C:D         0     0     0      16\n\nLet’s make sure that the formula we derived above is exactly what lm is doing.\n\n\n(1 / 16) * t(X) %*% drill$rate\n\n\n               [,1]\n(Intercept) 6.15250\nA           0.45875\nB           3.21875\nC           1.64625\nD           1.14500\nA:B         0.29500\nA:C         0.07750\nB:C         0.75500\nA:D         0.41875\nB:D         0.79625\nC:D         0.22375\nA:B:C       0.08125\nA:B:D       0.38000\nA:C:D       0.29250\nB:C:D       0.08750\nA:B:C:D     0.27125\n\ncoef(fit) #

We’ll have to make these notions precise.\nWe won’t give formal proofs of optimality (it’s beyond the scope of our book). But we will use simulations to get a sense of the key phenomena at work here, and we’ll create names (like \\(D-\\), \\(G-\\), and \\(I\\)-optimality) to describe what we see.\nSimulation\nFor simplicity, let’s consider \\(K = 1\\).\nWe know that we can use linear regression to estimate factor effects.\nSuppose that the underlying function is a true linear regression\nSuppose our budget is \\(n = 4\\).\nHow should we distributed our four points in order to achieve a good estimate of the underlying linear regression?\n\n\ndisplay(readImage(\"https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/zm5ork632pktbbryzvs4ex6fbvd78z72.png\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndisplay(readImage(\"https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/48czl1on1krut0gquz5arqdb5a81ft40.png\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndisplay(readImage(\"https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/0s7m67r9k447irxr8jdzmta8h0ea2seg.png\"))\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Three candidate designs explored in our \\(K = 1\\) simulation.\n\n\n\nHere are three candidates,\nNear the origin: Place two points each at -0.1 and 0.1.\nEquispaced: Place the four points equally spaced between -1 and 1\nBoundaries: Place 2 points at -1 and 2 at 1\n\n\nN <- 10\nx <- c(rep(-0.1, 2), rep(0.1, 2))\nsim_data <- list()\nsim_data[[\"close\"]] <- simulate(x, f)\nx <- seq(-1, 1, length.out = 4)\nsim_data[[\"equi\"]] <- simulate(x, f)\nx <- c(rep(-1, 2), rep(1, 2))\nsim_data[[\"2k\"]] <- simulate(x, f)\nsim_df <- bind_rows(sim_data, .id = \"design\")\n\n\n\n\n\np <- ggplot(sim_df %>% filter(rep < 100)) +\n  geom_point(aes(x = x, y = y)) +\n  geom_abline(slope = 3, intercept = -1, col = \"red\") +\n  geom_abline(aes(slope = slope, intercept = intercept, color = design)) +\n  scale_color_brewer(palette = \"Set2\") +\n  facet_grid(design ~ .) +\n  transition_time(rep)\nanimate(p, fps=10)\n\n\n\n\nTo illustrate this idea, consider the animation here.

This reveals a kind of heteroskedasticity,\nWe don’t do any transforms, but instead recommend low temperature, high resin flow, and low clamp time (because lower clamp time -> lower variability)\nLessons:\nIn practice, it’s often useful to take variability into account, rather than just average response\nA residual plot can be directly actionable\nAside: Dispersion estimates\nThe heuristic in the previous example can be formalized.\nLet \\(S^2\\left(j^{+}\\right)\\) be an estimated standard deviation of responses when contrast \\(j\\) is active.\nTheory predicts that \\(\\log\\left(\\frac{S^{2}\\left(j^{+}\\right)}{S^{2}\\left(j^{-}\\right)}\\right)\\) will be approximately normal.\nWe call these the dispersions\n\nMotivates looking at normal probability plots of dispersions, to see if any factors have high discrepancies in spread, as a function of level\n\n\nM <- model.matrix(defects ~ A * B * C * D, data = windows)[, -1] # remove intercept\nprint(M)\n\n\n    A  B  C  D A:B A:C B:C A:D B:D C:D A:B:C A:B:D A:C:D B:C:D\n1  -1 -1 -1 -1   1   1   1   1   1   1    -1    -1    -1    -1\n2   1 -1 -1 -1  -1  -1   1  -1   1   1     1     1     1    -1\n3  -1  1 -1 -1  -1   1  -1   1  -1   1     1     1    -1     1\n4  -1 -1  1 -1   1  -1  -1   1   1  -1     1    -1     1     1\n5  -1 -1 -1  1   1   1   1  -1  -1  -1    -1     1     1     1\n6   1  1 -1 -1   1  -1  -1  -1  -1   1    -1    -1     1     1\n7   1 -1  1 -1  -1   1  -1  -1   1  -1    -1     1    -1     1\n8   1 -1 -1  1  -1  -1   1   1  -1  -1     1    -1    -1     1\n9  -1  1  1 -1  -1  -1   1   1  -1  -1    -1     1     1    -1\n10 -1  1 -1  1  -1   1  -1  -1   1  -1     1    -1     1    -1\n11 -1 -1  1  1   1  -1  -1  -1  -1   1     1     1    -1    -1\n12  1  1  1 -1   1   1   1  -1  -1  -1     1    -1    -1    -1\n13  1 -1  1  1  -1   1  -1   1  -1   1    -1    -1     1    -1\n14  1  1 -1  1   1  -1  -1   1   1  -1    -1     1    -1    -1\n15 -1  1  1  1  -1  -1   1  -1   1   1    -1    -1    -1     1\n16  1  1  1  1   1   1   1   1   1   1     1     1     1     1\n   A:B:C:D\n1        1\n2       -1\n3       -1\n4       -1\n5       -1\n6        1\n7        1\n8        1\n9        1\n10       1\n11       1\n12      -1\n13      -1\n14      -1\n15      -1\n16       1\n\n\n\nS <- list()\nfor (k in seq_len(ncol(M))) {\n  S[[k]] <- data.frame(\n    \"effect\" = colnames(M)[k],\n    \"sd_plus\" = sd(windows$residual[M[, k] == 1]),\n    \"sd_minus\" = sd(windows$residual[M[, k] == -1])\n  )\n}\nS <- do.call(rbind, S)\ns_ratio <- setNames(log(S$sd_plus / S$sd_minus), S$effect)\ndaniel_plot(s_ratio)\n\n\n\n\nExample 6.5\nAn \\(2^{4}\\) experiment is setup to improve semiconductor manufacturing.\nQuestion: How do temperature (A), time (B), pressure (C), and gas flow (D) affect oxide thickness of the wafers?\nFour wafers are put in the furnace at a time\nThese are repeated measures, not replicates!\nTherefore, take the average of the wafers, and treat this as an unreplicated design\n\nAn analysis of the variation in average thickness across factor configurations is displayed below.\n\n\noxide <- read_csv(\"https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/vyk6uoe3zbnonv4n6jcusbrocmt4cvru.csv\") %>%\n  pivot_longer(starts_with(\"wafer\"), names_to = \"variable\")\noxide_collapse <- oxide %>%\n  group_by(A, B, C, D) %>%\n  summarise(mean = mean(value), var = var(value))\nggplot(oxide) +\n  geom_point(aes(x = A, y = value, col = as.factor(B))) +\n  scale_color_brewer(palette = \"Set2\") +\n  facet_grid(C ~ D)\n\n\n\nfit <- lm(mean ~ A * B * C * D, data = oxide_collapse)\ndaniel_plot(2 * coef(fit)[-1])\n\n\n\nfit <- lm(mean ~ A * (B + C), data = oxide_collapse)\nsummary(fit) # compare with Table 6.20\n\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = mean ~ A * (B + C), data = oxide_collapse)\n\nResiduals:\n   Min     1Q Median     3Q    Max \n-7.125 -2.469  1.000  2.250  6.625 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

For now, we’ll analyze the 3 factor case (the \\(2^3\\) design), but with an eye out for more general patterns\nFor the \\(2^3\\) design, we have 8 factor configurations\nVisualize as corners of a cube\nCall the third factor \\(C\\).\n\n\n\nplasma <- read.table(\"https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/f3sggiltyl5ycw1gu1vq7uv7omp4pjdg.txt\", header = TRUE) %>%\n  mutate(\n    A = as.factor(A),\n    B = as.factor(B),\n    C = as.factor(C)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(plasma) +\n  geom_point(\n    aes(x = A, y = B, col = Rate),\n    position = position_jitter(w = 0.1, h = 0.1)\n  ) +\n  facet_grid(C ~ .) +\n  scale_color_viridis_c() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\")\n\n\n\n\nEffect Estimates\nOur table notation can be extended to deal with all 8 corners of the cube.\nA\nB\nC\nlabel\n-\n-\n-\n(1)\n+\n-\n-\na\n-\n+\n-\nb\n-\n-\n+\nc\n+\n+\n-\nab\n+\n-\n+\nac\n-\n+\n+\nbc\n+\n+\n+\nabc\nThe main effect estimates can be made by subtracting the + from the - corners. Equivalently, this can be viewed as the difference in averages,\nwhen the factor is on vs. off\nbetween one face of the cube and its opposite\n\nFor example, to estimate the main effect of \\(A\\), we can use, \\[A = \\frac{1}{2^2 n}\\left[\\left(a + ab + ac + abc\\right) - \\left(\\left(1\\right) + b + c + bc\\right)\\right]\\]\nTo estimate interactions, we compare how the average effects of a variable change when we condition on the value of another variable.

    "contents": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA special case of general factorial design is the \\(2^K\\) design. This arises when there are \\(K\\) factors, but only 2 levels for each factor. We assume \\(n\\) samples at each configuration of factor levels. With only two levels for each factor, these experiments aren’t useful for teasing out subtle variations across levels of a factor. However they are useful for determining which of a large number of factors might be worth investigating further (factor screening).\nThe simplest case of a \\(2^K\\) design is when the number of factors \\(K = 2\\). The experimental design can be represented by a square.\n\n\n\nNotation\nIt will be handy to define ways of indexing corners of the square. One approach is to write + or - for whether we are at a low or high level for that factor. Alternatively, we can represent the corner by all the letters that are at high levels.\n\n\n\nA\nB\nlabel\n-\n-\n(1)\n+\n-\na\n-\n+\nb\n+\n+\nab\nWe abuse notation and write \\(a\\) to represent the total of the response values at the corner +-, rather than just the index of that corner.\nEstimating effects\nSince there are only two levels for each factor, there are transparent formulas for estimating main and interaction effects.\nThe main effect for A summaries the average change in the response when A is activated.

In the three factor design, we use the model\n\\[y_{ijkl} = \\mu + \\tau_i + \\beta_j + \\gamma_k +\n\\left(\\tau \\beta\\right)_{ij} + \\left(\\tau \\gamma\\right)_{ik} + \\left(\\beta\n\\gamma\\right)_{jk} + \\left(\\tau \\beta \\gamma\\right)_{ijk} + \\epsilon_{ijkl}\\]\nwhere \\(\\epsilon_{ijkl} \\sim N\\left(0, \\sigma^2\\right)\\). Suppose that the first, second, and third factors have \\(a, b\\), and \\(c\\) levels, respectively.\nWe’re dangerously close to getting lost in index purgatory, but notice certain symmetries,\n\n\n\n* We have main effects for each factor\n    * $\\tau_i, \\beta_j, \\gamma_k$\n\n* We have two-way interactions for each pair of factors\n    * $\\left(\\tau\\beta\\right)_{ij}, \\dots$\n    \n* We have a three-way interaction, between all factors\n    * $\\left(\\tau\\beta\\gamma\\right)_{ijk}$\nWe can calculate sum-of-squares terms for each of the terms. Notice that there are also certain symmetries in the degrees of freedom,\n\\(SS_A = a - 1\\)\n\\(SS_B = b - 1\\)\n\\(SS_C = c - 1\\)\n\\(SS_{AB} = (a - 1)(b - 1)\\)\n\\(SS_{BC} = (b - 1)(c - 1)\\)\n…\n\\(SS_{ABC} = (a - 1)(b - 1)(c - 1)\\)\nWhat do you think is the pattern for arbitrary \\(K\\).\nFor testing, we will compare these sums-of-squares to \\(SS_E\\), which has \\(abc(n - 1)\\) degrees of freedom. The \\(F\\)-statistics for any of the terms above can be found by dividing the associate mean squares against \\(MS_E\\). Hence, we can test whether any of the terms is nonzero for at least one value of its index.\nData Example\nLet’s look at a \\(2^3\\) design (3 factors with two levels each). The goal is to see how the etch rate on a chip varies as you change (A) gap between electrodes,\npower level, and (C) gas flow rate.\n\n\nplasma <- read.table(\"https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/f3sggiltyl5ycw1gu1vq7uv7omp4pjdg.txt\", header=TRUE)\n\n\n\nLooking at the data, there seems to be a strong interaction between A (the x-axis) and C (the pairs of columns): the slope of the effect of A switches when you go from one C configuration to the other.\n\n\nggplot(plasma) +\n  geom_point( aes(x = A, y = Rate) ) +\n  facet_grid(B ~ C)\n\n\n\n\nWe can quantify the strength of these relationships by estimating the model and evaluating the relevant \\(F\\)-statistics.

The idea is simple: use a flexible (nonlinear) function from experimental inputs (combinations of factor levels) to the response of interest. This will work as long as the response varies smoothly as factor inputs are perturbed. The estimated function will be a good representation of how varying the factors affects the response.\nMoreover, if we have successfully estimated this function, then we’ll be able to use the fit to (a) determine important influences and (b) find configurations that optimize the response (e.g., maximize profit[^Or if you are disgruntled, minimize profit]).\nHow should we fit these flexible functions?\nPolynomial regression: include terms like \\(x_i^2, x_i^3, x_i^2 x_j, ...\\)\nSpline regression: Include polynomial terms, but split across different regions of the input space. This is generally more stable than polynomial regression.\nReally, you can use whatever function fitter that you want. Unfortunately, this idea will have to wait till near the end of the course for a more complete elaboration.\n\nData Example\nLet’s look at this idea using the battery data from before.

Caution: \\(\\beta_j\\) now indexes a treatment of interest. It is not just nuisance blocking variation.\n\nTesting\nUp until now, we’ve only asked whether one particular factor had an influence on the response, as the levels were changed. Now, we care about each of the factors, and each gets a hypothesis test.\n(Hypothesis A) For the first factor, \\[\nH_0 &: \\tau_1 = \\dots = \\tau_a = 0 \\\\\nH_{1} &: \\tau_{i} \\neq 0 \\text{ for at least one } i\n\\]\n(Hypothesis B) For the second factor, \\[\nH_0 &: \\beta_1 = \\dots = \\beta_{b} = 0 \\\\\nH_{1} &: \\beta_{j} \\neq 0 \\text{ for at least one } j\n\\]\n(Hypothesis AB) Are there interaction effects? \\[\nH_0: \\left(\\tau\\beta\\right)_{ij}= \\dots = \\left(\\tau\\beta\\right)_{ij} = 0 \\\\\nH_1: \\left(\\tau\\beta\\right)_{ij} &= 0 \\text{ for at least one } ij \\text{ combination}\n\\]\nFor each of these hypothesis tests, we’re going to need a test statistic that’s sensitive to departures from the null. We’re also going to need their reference distributions.\nMiraculously, we have the identity, \\[\\begin{align*}\n\\sum_{i j k}\\left(y_{i j k}-\\bar{y}\\right)^{2}=& b n \\sum_{i}\\left(\\bar{y}_{i . .}-\\bar{y}\\right)^{2}+\\\\\n& a n \\sum_{j}\\left(\\bar{y}_{j} .-\\bar{y}\\right)^{2}+\\\\\n& n \\sum_{i, j}\\left(\\bar{y}_{i j}-\\bar{y}_{i .}-\\bar{y}_{. j}-\\bar{y}\\right)^{2}+\\\\\n& \\sum_{i, j, k}\\left(y_{i j k}-\\bar{y}_{i j} .\\right)^{2}\n\\end{align*}\\] which we’ll denote \\(SS_{\\text{Total}}=SS_{A}+SS_{B}+SS_{AB}+SS_{E}\\).\nThe punchline is that if \\(SS_{A}\\) is large, we have evidence against hypothesis A, if \\(SS_{B}\\) is large we have evidence against hypothesis B, and if \\(SS_{AB}\\) is large, we have evidence against hypothesis AB.\nWe can define corresponding mean squares by dividing by the degrees of freedom.

What should we do if we have an upper limit on the number of samples we can obtain for each block? For example,\nThe amount of material per block gets exhausted after 3 samples are prepared, and we want to study 4 treatments\nWe’re interested in three shoe sole types\nWe’ll have to settle on an Incomplete Block Design: not all treatments appear in each block. We should assign treatments randomly. We will call a design balanced if any pair of treatments appears together in a block the same number of times.\nSome helpful notation,\n\\(a\\): Number of treatment levels\n\\(b\\): Number of blocks\n\\(k\\): Number of treatments per block\n\\(r\\): Number of blocks per treatment\n\\(\\lambda\\): Number of appearances for each level pair\n\nAn identity that relates these variables is \\(\\lambda (a - 1) = r(k - 1)\\). We can derive it by counting the number of samples that occur in blocks containing treatment A, excluding the samples given treatment A.\nHypothesis Testing\nThe model is the same as in the RCBD, \\[\ny_{ij} = \\mu + \\tau_i + \\beta_j + \\epsilon_{ij}\n\\] where \\(\\epsilon_{ij} \\sim \\mathcal{N}\\left(0, \\sigma^2\\right)\\) independently and \\(\\sum_{i} \\tau_i= \\sum_{j} \\beta_{j}=0\\). The difference is that we don’t observe \\(y_{ij}\\) for all combinations of blocks and treatments.\nTo test the hypothesis,\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\nH_0 &: \\tau_1 = \\dots = \\tau_a = 0 \\\\\nH_{1} &: \\tau_{i} \\neq 0 \\text{ for at least one } i\n\\end{aligned}\\]\nwe can use a decomposition, \\[\nSS_{\\text{Total}} = SS_{\\text{Treatments}\\left(adjusted\\right)} + SS_{\\text{Block}} + SS_{E}\n\\]\nThe \\(SS_{\\text{Total}}\\) and \\(SS_{\\text{Block}}\\) terms are familiar, except they are only summed over terms that are observed, \\[\\begin{align}\nSS_{\\text{Total}} &= \\sum_{i, j} \\left(y_{ij} - \\bar{y}_{\\cdot\\cdot}\\right)^2 \\\\\nSS_{\\text{Block}} &= k \\sum_{j} \\left(\\bar{y}_{\\cdot j} - \\bar{y}_{\\cdot\\cdot}\\right)^2\n\\end{align}\\]\nBut \\(SS_{\\text{Treatments}}\\) is not the expression you might guess at first. The reason is each treatment only appears in a subset of blocks, which might bias conclusions.\nAn adjusted expression corrects for this bias,\n\\[\\begin{align*}\nSS_{\\text{Treatments }(adjusted )}=\\frac{k}{\\lambda a} \\sum_{i=1}^{a}\\left(\\bar{y}_{i}-\\frac{1}{k} \\sum_{j \\in B(j)} \\bar{y}_{\\cdot j}\\right)^2\n\\end{align*}\\] where \\(B\\left(j\\right)\\) indexes the blocks within which treatment i was administered.\n\\(SS_E\\) is obtained through subtraction, and turns out to have \\(N - a - b + 1\\) degrees of freedom. Therefore,\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{M S_{\\text {Treatment }(\\text { adjusted })}}{M S_{E}} &:=\\frac{\\frac{1}{a-1} S S_{\\text {Treatment }(\\text { adjusted })}}{\\frac{1}{N-a-b+1} S S_{E}} \\\\\n& \\sim F(a-1, N-a-b+1)\n\\end{aligned}\\]\nwhich can be used as the basis for a hypothesis test.\n\n\n\n",

How should we design experiments when there are several factors, all of interest?\nThis is the most common situation we encounter in practice, and the remainder of the course is going to be devoted to solutions to this problem, all based on the idea of factorial designs.\nFor example, consider,\nBattery life: An engineer wants to study how long a battery will last, as a function of temperature and material used in construction.\nBottling: The fill height of a bottling machine depends on percent carbonation, operating pressure, and assembly line speed, but the precise relationship is currently unknown.\n\nVisualizing Factorial Designs\nWhen you have two factors and a continuous response, you can visualize the relationship either in 3D, or from the top down.\nIf the factor has only two levels, the possible configurations are corners square (hypercube, in higher dimensions).\nIf it can vary continuously, you get a surface\n\nWhen you have more than two factors, you have to pick a subset of factors to visualize at a time, and show multiple surfaces for each configuration of other factors.\nMain and Interaction Effects\nThe main effect of a factor is the amount that the response changes when you change its value by one unit. The main effect is defined as the average response change, where the average is taken over values of all other factors\nIt’s possible that the change in response of one factor depends on the value of other factors. In this case, we say there is an interaction between the factor and the factors that cause changes in effect sizes.\nYou can encode an interaction through a regression equation \\[\ny = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2 + \\beta_{12} x_{1} x_{2}\n\\]\nWhen \\(\\beta_{12}\\) is nonzero, there is an interaction between \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\).\nIn this case, the slopes of \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\) are not fixed, and each depends on the value of the other variable.\n\n\n\n\n",

Furthermore, assume that we care about \\(p\\) different treatments.\nThe intuition for Latin Squares is similar to the intuition for RCBD,\n\nMake sure to run each treatment on each nuisance factor.

Suppose that the nuisance factor is known and controllable. For simplicity, also assume that the blocks have the same number \\(a\\) of samples as we have treatments (\\(a=2 \\to\\) pairing)\nExample [page 120]. A medical device manufacturer creates vascular grafts, and wants to see the effect of manufacturing pressure on defect rate. But the resin used to make the graft arrives in batches, and may itself contribute to defects.\n\nIdea: Randomly assign each of the a treatments to the units within each block. This is called the RCBD.\n\nThis is a restriction on randomization. Only random treatment assignments where each block has each treatment are allowed. In the medical example, we would test all the manufacturing pressures on each of the resin batches, rather than having batches that receive only subsets of pressures.\nModel Setup\nFor hypothesis testing, we need a probability model.

Two ways to fit them are (1) the method of moments and (2) maximum likelihood.\nMethod of Moments\nFor estimating \\(\\mu\\), this method uses the overall mean \\(\\bar{y}\\).\nWhat about the \\(\\sigma^2\\)’s? The key identity is, \\[\\begin{align*}\n\\mathbf{E}\\left[MS_{\\text{treatments}}\\right] &= \\sigma^2 + n \\sigma_{\\tau}^2 \\\\\n\\mathbf{E}\\left[MS_{E}\\right] &= \\sigma^2\n\\end{align*}\\]\nWe can approximate the expected values through, \\[\\begin{align*}\nMS_{\\text{treatments} \\approx \\sigma^2 + n \\sigma_{\\tau}^2 \\\\\nMS_{E} \\approx \\sigma^2\n\\end{align*}\\]\nIf we pretended these approximations were exact equalities, then we have two equations with two unknowns. The method of moments defines parameter estimates as the solutions to that system of equations. \\[\\begin{align}\n\\hat{\\sigma}^2 &= MS_{E} \\\\\n\\hat{\\sigma}^2_{\\tau} &= \\frac{1}{n}\\left[MS_{\\text{treatments}} - MS_{E}\\right]\n\\end{align}\\]\nHow can we get confidence intervals for these estimates?\nFor \\(\\hat{\\mu} = \\bar{y}\\), we can use \\(\\text{Var}\\left(y\\right) &= \\frac{1}{N} \\text{Var}\\left(y_{ij}\\right)=\\frac{1}{N}\\left(\\sigma^2 + n\\sigma^2_{\\tau}\\right)\\)\nFor \\(\\hat{\\sigma}^2\\), we can use the fact that \\(\\frac{N - a}{\\sigma^2}MS_{E} \\sim \\chi^2_{N - a}\\).\nFor $^2_{}, we’re out of luck, though some papers give approximate confidence intervals.\n\nMaximum Likelihood Estimation\nAn alternative approach is to use maximum likelihood. The first step is to stack all the \\(y_{ij}\\)’s into one long length \\(N\\) vector, and observe that the data are jointly normally distributed, \\[\n\\left(\\begin{array}{c}\ny_{11} \\\\\ny_{12} \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\ny_{a(n-1)} \\\\\ny_{a n}\n\\end{array}\\right) \\sim \\mathcal{N}\\left(\\mu 1_{N},\\left(\\begin{array}{cccc}\n\\sigma^{2} I_{n}+\\sigma_{\\tau}^{2} 1_{n} 1_{n}^{T} & \\mathbf{0} & \\ldots & \\mathbf{0} \\\\\n\\mathbf{0} & \\sigma^{2} I_{n}+\\sigma_{\\tau}^{2} 1_{n} 1_{n}^{T} & \\ldots & \\mathbf{0} \\\\\n\\vdots & \\vdots & & \\vdots \\\\\n\\mathbf{0} & \\mathbf{0} & \\ldots & \\sigma^{2} I_{n}+\\sigma_{\\tau}^{2} 1_{n} 1_{n}^{T}\n\\end{array}\\right)\\right)\n\\]\nThe specific form of the covariance isn’t important. What is important is that we can exactly evaluate the probability of \\(y_{11}, y_{12},\\dots, y_{an}\\) under any choice of the parameters \\(\\mu, \\sigma^2, \\sigma^2_{\\tau}\\).\nDefine \\(L(\\mu, \\sigma^2, \\sigma^2_{\\tau})\\) to be the probability of the dataset \\(y_{11}, y_{12}, \\dots y_{an}\\) viewed as a function of the normal distribution’s parameters. A good estimate for these parameters comes from finding the configuration that maximizes \\(L\\left(\\mu, \\sigma^2, \\sigma^2_{\\tau}\\right)\\). The maximizers can’t be found analytically, but algorithms exist to find the maximizers.\nSoftware also gives a confidence interval for the estimates. It works by studying the curvature of the likelihood function at the maximizer, though we don’t need to worry about the details.\n\n\n\n",

To implement this idea quantitatively,\nTransform the data to their ranks. The smallest of the \\(y_ij\\) becomes 1, the next smallest becomes 2, etc. Denote these ranks by \\(R_{ij}\\).\nCompute the test statistic \\[\n\\frac{1}{S^2}\\left[\\sum_{i = 1}^{a} \\frac{R_{i\\cdot}^2}{n_{i}} - \\frac{N\\left(N + 1\\right)^2}{4}\\right]\n\\] where we define \\(R_{i\\cdot}\\) to be the sum of the ranks in the \\(i^{th}\\) group, and \\[\nS^2 = \\frac{1}{N - 1} \\left[\\sum_{i, j} R_{ij}^2 - \\frac{N\\left(N + 1\\right)^2}{4}\\right].\n\\]\nCompare the test statistic to a \\(\\chi^2_{a -1}\\) reference distribution. If it seems too large to be plausible, reject the null hypothesis.\nWhere did this test statistic come from? It’s possible to show that the statistic is equivalent to\n\\[\n\\frac{\\sum_{i} n_{i}\\left(\\bar{R}_{i} - \\bar{R}\\right)^2}{\\frac{1}{N - 1}\\sum_{i, j} \\left(R_{ij} - \\bar{R}\\right)^2}\n\\] which compares the average rank in group \\(i\\) to the average rank overall, and standardizes by the overall variance of the ranks. The first formula is the one presented in the book, though, and it’s easier to calculate by hand.\nWhy not always use nonparametric ANOVA? If the data are actually normal, than this approach has less power than standard ANOVA. If you have doubts about validity, a safe approach is to try both. If the approaches approximately agree, default to standard ANOVA.\n\n\n\n",

When we reject the null in ANOVA, we know at least one of the treatments deviates from the global average. But which one(s)?\nContrasts address this question. A contrast is a linear combination of the means, \\[\n\\Gamma(c)=\\sum_{i=1}^{a} c_{i} \\mu_{i}\n\\] For any particular \\(c\\), we test \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n&H_{0}: \\Gamma(c)=0 \\\\\n&H_{1}: \\Gamma(c) \\neq 0\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nTo see that this is actually something worth doing, consider the case that we have 4 different means, \\(\\mu_1, \\mu_2, \\mu_3, \\mu_4\\),\nc = (1, 1, -1, -1): Are the first two means different from the last two, on average?\nc = (1, -1, 0, 0): Are the first two means equal to each other?\netc.\n\nTesting Contrasts\nRemember the hypothesis testing recipe. We need, (a) a test statistic and (b) a reference distribution for that statistic.\nOur best guess at \\(\\mu_i\\) is \\(\\bar{y}_i\\), so a reasonable statistic is,\n\\[\n\\hat{\\Gamma}(c)=\\sum_{i=1}^{a} c_{i} \\bar{y}_{i}\n\\]\nHow will we find its reference distribution? Under the null, this statistic is normally distributed with mean 0 and variance, \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\operatorname{Var}(\\hat{\\Gamma}(c)) &=\\sum_{i=1}^{a} c_{i}^{2} \\operatorname{Var}\\left(\\bar{y}_{i}\\right) \\\\\n&=\\frac{\\sigma^{2}}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{a} c_{i}^{2}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] Standardizing our original statistic, we obtain,\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{\\hat{\\Gamma}(c)}{\\sqrt{\\operatorname{Var}(\\hat{\\Gamma}(c))}} &=\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{a} c_{i} \\bar{y}_{i}}{\\sqrt{\\frac{\\sigma^{2}}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{a} c_{i}^{2}}} \\\\\n& \\approx \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{a} c_{i} \\bar{y}_{i}}{\\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{\\sigma}^{2}}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{a} c_{i}^{2}}}\n\\end{aligned}\\]\nTo estimate \\(\\sigma^2\\), we can use \\(\\hat{\\sigma}^2 := MS_E\\). This is a good choice, because it remains valid even when the null is untrue.\nSince we plugged-in the estimate \\(\\hat{\\sigma}^2\\), we have divided our normal distribution by the square root of a chi-square. The result is therefore t-distributed, with \\(N - a\\) df.\nConfidence Intervals for Contrasts\nIf we make the same computations as above, but without assuming that the null is true, we would find that, \\[\n\\mathbf{P}\\left(\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{a} c_{i} \\bar{y}_{i}-\\sum_{i=1}^{a} c_{i} \\mu_{i}}{\\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{\\sigma}^{2}}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{a} c_{i}^{2}}} \\in\\left[t_{\\text {left }}, t_{\\text {right }}\\right]\\right)=0.95\n\\] where we choose \\(t_{\\text{left}}\\) and \\(t_{\\text{right}}\\) to be the 0.025 and 0.975 quantiles of a \\(t\\)-distribution with \\(N - a\\) df.\nThe resulting confidence interval is,\n\\[\n\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{a} c_{i} \\bar{y}_{i}-t_{\\text {right }} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{\\sigma}^{2}}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{a} c_{i}^{2}}, \\sum_{i=1}^{a} c_{i} \\bar{y}_{i}+t_{\\text {right }} \\sqrt{\\left.\\frac{\\hat{\\sigma}^{2}}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{a} c_{i}^{2}\\right]}\\right.\n\\] This is an explicit formula that you can use in your computations, but don’t let the complexity of the symbols here confuse you. Returning to our original definitions, this is just, \\[\n\\left[\\hat{\\Gamma}(c)-t_{\\mathrm{left}} \\sqrt{\\widehat{\\operatorname{Var}}(\\hat{\\Gamma}(c))}, \\hat{\\Gamma}(c)+t_{\\mathrm{left}} \\sqrt{\\widehat{\\operatorname{Var}}(\\hat{\\Gamma}(c))}\\right]\n\\] where we’re writing \\(\\hat{\\text{Var}}\\) instead of \\(\\text{Var}\\) because we’re plugging in the estimate \\(\\hat{\\sigma}^2\\).\n\n\n\n",

But what if we hadn’t planned any, and go in search for significant results using different contrasts?\nImagine testing 100 hypothesis at = 0.05. Suppose they are all null). We would see 5 rejected null hypotheses on average.\nTherefore, if we want to allow ourselves some flexibility in searching over contrasts, we need to adapt our methodology. We should control the experimentwise error rate, the probability that any test results in a false positive.\nScheffe’s Method\nLet’s say we’re interested in \\(m\\) contrasts, \\(c_1, ,c_m\\). The idea is to widen our confidence intervals slightly, to make false positives rarer.\nHow much should the intervals be widened? It’s not obvious, but Scheffe found that we should multiply the endpoints of each of our \\(m\\) intervals by \\[\n\\sqrt{\\left(a - 1\\right)F_{0.025, a - 1, N - a}}\n\\] (this is for 95% confidence intervals).\nTukey’s Method\nIf we only care about the differences between pairs of group means, we can use Tukey’s method. All the contrasts now have the form, \\[\n\\Gamma\\left(c\\right) = \\mu_i - \\mu_j\n\\]\nWe’re going to make confidence intervals for these, and it’s natural to center them around, \\[\n\\hat{\\Gamma}\\left(c\\right) &= \\bar{y}_i - \\bar{y}_j.\n\\]\nHow wide should the intervals be? Tukey found a reference distribution for \\[\n\\frac{\\bar{y}_{\\max }-\\bar{y}_{\\min }}{\\frac{\\hat{\\sigma}}{\\sqrt{n}}}\n\\] where \\(\\bar{y}_{\\text{max}}\\) refers to the maximum group’s average across the \\(a\\) groups. From there, he tabulated the quantiles as \\(q_{\\alpha}(a, \\text{df})\\).\nIt turns out that the appropriate width of the confidence intervals can be derived from these quantiles, \\[\n\\left[\\left(\\bar{y}_{i}-\\bar{y}_{j}\\right)-q_{\\alpha}(a, \\text{df}) \\frac{\\hat{\\sigma}}{\\sqrt{n}},\\left(\\bar{y}_{i}-\\bar{y}_{j}\\right)+q_{\\alpha}(a, \\text{df}) \\frac{\\hat{\\sigma}}{\\sqrt{n}}\\right]\n\\]\nThis works because if the difference between the max and min group averages is contained within this interval, then all pairs \\(i, j\\) of differences are also contained in this interval.\nFisher’s Least Significant Difference\nFisher’s LSD is used to compare pairs of means. Unlike Tukey’s method, it doesn’t control the experimentwise error rate\nNotice that the variance of the differences is \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\operatorname{Var}\\left(\\bar{y}_{i}-\\bar{y}_{j}\\right) &=\\operatorname{Var}\\left(\\bar{y}_{i}\\right)+\\operatorname{Var}\\left(\\bar{y}_{j}\\right) \\\\\n&=\\frac{\\sigma^{2}}{n_{i}}+\\frac{\\sigma^{2}}{n_{j}} \\\\\n& \\approx \\hat{\\sigma}^{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{n_{i}}+\\frac{1}{n_{j}}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nFisher’s LSD compares each difference \\(\\left|y_- y_j\\right|\\) to the cutoff, \\[\nt_{\\text {right }} \\sqrt{\\hat{\\sigma}^{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{n_{i}}+\\frac{1}{n_{j}}\\right)}\n\\] and rejects the null that the pairs have equal means if the difference is larger.\n\n\n\n",

ANOVA breaks the observed variation into distinct components,\n\\[\n\\sum_{ij} \\color{#ff8200}{\\left(y_{ij} - \\bar{y}\\right)}^2 = n\\sum_{i} \\color{#447583}{\\left(\\bar{y}_i - \\bar{y}\\right)}^2 + \\sum_{i,j} \\color{#b090c2}{\\left(y_{ij} - \\bar{y}_{i}\\right)}^2\n\\] which is abbreviated as\n\\[\n\\color{#ff8200}{SS_{\\text{total}}} = \\color{#447583}{SS_{\\text{treatments}}} + \\color{#b090c2}{SS_{\\text{error}}}.\n\\] This is usually called the “ANOVA identity.”\nIf any of the groups had a mean that was different from the global mean, then you’d expect the  term to be larger than it would otherwise be. How large is large enough to reject?\nSince the variance within each group is \\(\\sigma^2\\), the variance of each \\(\\bar{y}_i\\) is \\(\\frac{\\sigma^2}{n}\\). The blue term looks like how we would usually estimate the variances of the \\(y_i\\), i.e.,\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{a}\\sum_{i}\\color{#447583}{\\left(y_i - \\bar{y}\\right)}^2 \\approx \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n}\n\\] 7. On the other hand, under the null, all the \\(y_{ij} \\sim \\mathcal{N}\\left(\\mu, \\sigma^2\\right)\\), so we would also know,\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{N-a} \\sum_{i, j}\\color{#b090c2}{\\left(y_{i, j}-\\bar{y}_{i}\\right)}^{2} \\approx \\sigma^{2},\n\\]\nso under the null,\n\\[\n\\frac{\\frac{\\color{#447583}{SS_{\\text {treatments }}}}{a-1}}{\\color{#b090c2}{\\frac{SS_{\\text {error }}}{N-a}}} \\approx 1.\n\\]\nNote that under the alternative, it would be larger than 1.\nFrom our results in the probability review lectures, both the  and  are chi-squares, with \\(a - 1\\) and \\(N - a\\) d.f., respectively. It’s not obvious, but they’re also independent (this is called Cochran’s theorem). Therefore, the null reference distribution is an \\(F\\) distribution with \\((a - 1, N - a)\\) d.f.\nThe ANOVA Table\nIf we introduce \\(\\color{#447583}{MS_{\\text{treatments}}}\\) and \\(\\color{#b090c2}{MS_{E}}\\) for the numerator and denominator in the ratio above, we can organize this information as,\nThis is also how most computer output will be displayed, so it’s worth being familiar with.\n\ni.e. the oppositive of “synthesis.”↩︎\n",

There are a few ways that this model can fail,\nThere might be systematic variations besides the group deviations \\(\\tau_i\\).\nThe errors might not be normally distributed\nThe errors might not be independent\nThe variance might not be the same in each group\n\nTo see if the model is okay, it will be helpful to define residuals, \\[\\begin{align*}\ne_{i j} &=y_{i j}-\\hat{y}_{i j} \\\\\n&=y_{i j}-\\bar{y}_{i}.\n\\end{align*}\\] Residuals are our best guess of what the true random error \\(\\epsilon_{ij}\\) is like.\nNormal Probability Plots\nWe can’t check normality of \\(\\epsilon_{ij}\\) directly, but we can check normality of the residuals \\(e_{ij}\\) using normal probability plots.\nIn the plot to the right, it looks like the data are somewhat more tightly clustered near the middle, though the most extreme points are more extreme than expected. Do you see why?\nOf the ways that the model can fail, normality of the residuals is not the most severe, because you can often count on the central limit theorem to make the reference \\(F\\) distribution still approximately correct.\nPlotting Residuals\nThe way to check for systematic variation beyond the \\(\\tau_i\\)’s, try plotting residuals against measured variables. If you see “patterns,” those may correspond to missing terms in the model.\nWe can use plots to check for independence. For example, if you plot the residuals over time and you see clear trends, then the errors are likely correlated over time.\nIt’s often useful to plot residuals against the fitted values. This can reveal nonconstant variance across the groups \\(i\\).\nTesting Equality of Variances\nThere are formal tests to test whether the equal variance assumption of the ANOVA is valid (it’s very meta). The most common are,\nBartlett’s test\nThe Modified Levene test\n\nThe main difference is that the Modified Levene test is still valid even when the errors are not normally distributed. You don’t need to memorize the test statistics, but know that they exist, and be able to interpret associated computer output.\nTransformations\nWhat can you do if you detect nonconstant variance across groups? The most common fix is to use a variance stabilizing transformation. That is, apply some function \\(f(x)\\) to each data point and then perform the ANOVA.\nThere are various rules of thumb1, though the process is still somewhat informal,\n\\(f(x) = \\sqrt{x}\\) or \\(f(x) = \\sqrt{1 + x}\\) if the data seem Poisson\n\\(f(x) = \\log x\\) if the data seem lognormal\n\\(f(x) = \\arcsin\\left(\\sqrt{x}\\right)\\) if the data are binomial-derived fractions\n\nThese are special cases. More generally, if you notice \\(\\sigma \\propto \\mu^\\alpha\\), then setting \\(f(x) = x^{1 - \\alpha}\\) will stabilize the variance.\n\nIt’s not at all obvious why any of these transformations are effective – they are typically derived in introductory mathematical statistics courses.↩︎\n",

One approach is based on hypothesis testing: we have a theory about the general (a null hypothesis), and we want to see whether our specific sample is consistent with that theory.

The specific measure of plausibility will depend on the form of the test – we will see a specific example in the next set of notes.\nTwo Sample t-test\nMotivating example: You have two ways of making concrete mortar. Is one stronger than the other? By default, you think they are equally strong. We can denote this (the null hypothesis) by,\n\\[\nH_0: \\mu_1 = \\mu_2\n\\]\nThe alternative hypothesis is that the strengths are not equal,\n\\[\nH_1: \\mu_1 \\neq \\mu_2\n\\]\nOur test statistic for detecting departures from this null will be,\n\\[\nt_0 := \\frac{\\bar{y}_1 - \\bar{y}_2}{S_p \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n_1} + \\frac{1}{n_2}}}\n\\] where we define the pooled standard deviation by,\n\\[\nS^2_p = \\frac{\\left(n_1 - 1\\right)S_1^2 + \\left(n_2 - 1\\right)S_2^2}{n_1 + n_2 -2}\n\\] and \\(S_1\\) and \\(S_2\\) are the usual standard deviations for each group individually. (consider what happens when \\(n_1 = n_2 = n\\))\nUnder the null hypothesis, this is a ratio between a standard normal and chi-square, so \\(t_0\\) is \\(t\\)-distributed with \\(n - 2\\) d.f. This gives reference distribution under the null.\nConfidence intervals\nInstead of thinking we know the mean and trying to reject it, why don’t we try to directly estimate it (with an error bar)? A 95% confidence interval is an interval \\([L, U]\\) satisfying,\n\\[\n\\mathbf{P}\\left(\\theta \\in \\left[L, U\\right]\\right) = 0.95\n\\]\nThe randomness here is in \\(L\\) and \\(U\\). If we were being more formal, we would write those as functions of the (random) sample,\n\\[\n\\left[L\\left(y_1, \\dots, y_n\\right), U\\left(y_1, \\dots, y_n\\right)\\right]\n\\]\nTo construct one for the two sample test, recall that, based on the \\(t\\)-distribution characterization from the probability-review lecture,\n\\[\nP\\left(\\left(\\frac{\\bar{y}_1 - \\bar{y}_2\\right) - \\left(\\mu_1 - \\mu_2\\right)}{S_p\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{n}}} \\in \\left[t_{0.025, 2\\left(n - 1\\right), t_{0.975, 2\\left(n - 1\\right)}}\\right]  \\right) = 0.95\n\\]\nTo simplify the algebra, let\n\\[\nT\\left(y\\right) := \\bar{y}_1 - \\bar{y}_2 \\\\\n\\theta := \\mu_1 - \\mu_2 \\\\\n\\hat{\\sigma} := S_p\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{n}} \\\\\nt_{0.025, 2\\left(n - 1\\right)} := t_{\\text{left}} \\\\\nt_{0.975, 2\\left(n - 1\\right)} := t_{\\text{right}}\n\\] so that the above expression reduces to,\n\\[\n\\mathbf{P}\\left(\\frac{T\\left(y\\right) - \\theta}{\\hat{\\sigma}} \\in \\left[t_{\\text{left}}, t_{\\text{right}}\\right]\\right) = 0.95\n\\]\nNow, if we rearrange terms, we find\n\\[\n\\mathbf{P}\\left(\\theta \\in \\left[T\\left(y\\right) - \\hat{\\sigma}t_{\\text{right}}, T\\left(y\\right) - \\hat{\\sigma}t_{\\text{left}}\\right]\\right) = 0.95\n\\] We can use the fact that \\(t_{\\text{left}} = -t_{\\text{right}}\\) to simplify the expression further to\n\\[\n\\mathbf{P}\\left(\\theta \\in \\left[T\\left(y\\right) - \\hat{\\sigma}t_{\\text{right}}, T\\left(y\\right) + \\hat{\\sigma}t_{\\text{right}}\\right]\\right) = 0.95\n\\] This is exactly the property that a confidence interval has to satisfy. Plugging in the original expressions gives the confidence interval for the difference in means, assuming shared variance.\n\n\n\n",

This measures the typical distance of \\(Y\\) around its mean.\nUseful properties\nFor calculations, it’s often easier to use properties of mean and variance to reduce to simpler expressions, rather than using the formulas above. For example, expectation is a linear function,\n\\[\n\\mathbf{E}\\left[c_{1}y_{1} + c_{2}y_{2}\\right] = c_{1}\\mathbf{E}\\left[y_{1}\\right] + c_{2}\\mathbf{E}\\left[y_{2}\\right].\n\\]\n\n\ninclude_graphics(\"https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/pvfua6rtht3vubmz50yi3xry02t2elo3.png\")\n\n\n\n\nVariance is not linear, but the variance of a linear combination of two random variables can be found simply enough,\n\\[\n\\mathbf{V}\\left[c_1 y_1 + c_2 y_2\\right] = c_1^2 \\mathbf{V}\\left[y_1\\right] + \n  c_2^2 \\mathbf{V}\\left[y_2\\right] +\n  c_1 c_2 \\textbf{Cov}\\left[y_1, y_2\\right]\n\\]\nwhere we define the covariance as,\n\\[\n\\textbf{Cov}\\left[y_1, y_2\\right] = \\mathbf{E}\\left[\\left(y_1 - \\mathbf{E}\\left[y_1\\right]\\right)\\left(\ny_2 - \\mathbf{E}\\left[y_2\\right]\\right)\\right]\n\\]\nSampling and Estimators\nWhy is probability useful in statistics. From a high-level, statistics is concerned with drawing inferences from the specific to the general. Starting from a sample, we would like to say something true about the population. A typical strategy is to compute a statistic (a function of the sample) to say something about the probability distribution that it was drawn from (a property of the population).\nSuppose we have observed \\(n\\) samples \\(y_{1}, \\dots, y_{n}\\). Two very useful statistics are the sample mean,\n\\[\n\\bar{y} = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i = 1}^{n}y_i\n\\] and the sample standard deviation \\[\nS = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n - 1}\\sum_{i = 1}^{n}\\left(y_i - \\bar{y}\\right)^2}\n\\]\n\n\ninclude_graphics(\"https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/o3li54yw6986aurviiljfmgmrmuh5wms.png\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninclude_graphics(\"https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/310ij7e4ki9xnn4doe191hks8k6h3o9z.png\")\n\n\n\n\nand the sample standard deviation,\nStatisticians have come up with a variety of properties that they would like their statistics to satisfy. Two common requirements are that the statistic be “unbiased” and “minimum variance.” Unbiased means it’s centered around the correct value, on average Minimum variance means it’s not too far from the correct value, on average.\nCentral limit theorem\nFor very many distributions, an appropriately rescaled version of the sample mean converges to a normal distribution. Specifically, if all the \\(y_i\\) are drawn i.i.d. from some distribution with mean \\(\\mu\\) and variance \\(\\sigma^2\\), then\n\\[\n\\frac{\\sqrt{n}\\left(\\bar{y} - \\mu\\right)}{\\sigma} \\to \\mathcal{N}\\left(0, 1\\right).\n\\]\nThis phenomenon is called the central limit theorem.\n\n\ninclude_graphics(\"https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/2nue43dk0rw0v25swmbd552qk1bz1jze.png\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

It’s not enough to passively watch – we need to see how turning certain “knobs” affects the system.\nTo illustrate, we can consider a planting example. There are a variety of factors that could influence how the plants grow (soil type, watering schedule, etc.). We could allocate different plots of land to trying different configurations of factors.

Suppose we are at a hospital and are trying to see whether a new treatment is effective. If we don’t randomize, we might end up only treating sicker patients than usual. If the sickest patients have worse outcomes on average, then we might underestimate the effectiveness of our treatment.\nIf we randomize, the differences coming from these extraneous factors (like amount of sickness) will cancel out.

Repeated measures are several measurements on the same experimental unit. Replicates are distinct experimental units drawn under the same overarching conditions.\n[Computer Chips]. If we were trying to build better computer chips, then repeated measures would be several measurements on the same chip. Replicates would be completely independent chips.\n\n\ninclude_graphics(\"https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/rqu00u66f4szo40wfevwmesslkniz2d6.png\")\n\n\n\ninclude_graphics(\"https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/inwjp3ntywaoim7vs88wehl6m73wu3pb.png\")\n\n\n\n\nBlocking\nThe final major principle of experimental design is blocking, defined as,\n\nA design technique used to improve the precision with which comparisons among the factors of interest are made. Often used to reduce or eliminate variability from nuisance factors.\n\n[Shoe soles] Suppose that we want to test the difference between these purple and green shoe sole types (which wears down faster?).\n\n\ninclude_graphics(\"https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/iimo8kf3idq1s9rjb8i853zbrlg989c2.png\")\n\n\n\ninclude_graphics(\"https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/8rmn6uh1enadfmfriq646bjvr3q5hx0w.png\")\n\n\n\n\nTwo designs seem natural,\nDesign 1 [No blocking]: Each person is randomly assigned a shoe sole type.\nDesign 2 Blocking: Each person gets one of each shoe sole, and randomly wears on on the left / right foot.\nUnder design 1, any true shoe sole effect would be drowned out by the amount of walking each person did In the blocked design, consistent effects within individuals become detectable. In this example, blocking helped remove nuiscance variation resulting from some people walking more than others.\n\n\ninclude_graphics(\"https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/rnuet4s27hhidnxde2ys5n3taw9ygjhy.png\")\n\n\n\ninclude_graphics(\"https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/8rmn6uh1enadfmfriq646bjvr3q5hx0w.png\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

If we considered only two factors at a time, each with two possible levels, this would be called a \\(2^2\\) design.\nWe can visualize the 4 possible configurations as corners of a square The golf score is the height of the plane.\n\n\ninclude_graphics(\"https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/nl6161tped9imsph7qc8c830mmh4ru02.png\")\n\n\n\n\nMathematically,\n\\[\ny = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x_{1} + \\beta_{2}x_{2} + \\epsilon\n\\]\nInteractions\nIt’s possible that the effect of one factor depends on the value of the other – this called an interaction between the two factors. If this happens, then the slopes along the edges are no longer parallel. The previous formula cannot capture this. Instead, we need,\n\\[\ny = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x_{1} + \\beta_{2}x_{2} + \\beta_{12}x_{1}x_{2} + \\epsilon\n\\]\nbecause now the slopes can change depending on the value of the other factor.\n\n\ninclude_graphics(\"https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/hwusoeowryssz905tm5qsf6s9vbkxvd9.png\")\n\n\n\n\nFor example, rearranging terms, we can see that the slope for \\(x_1\\) depends on the value of \\(x_2\\),\n\\[\ny = \\beta_{0} + \\left(\\beta_{1} + \\beta_{12}x_2\\right)x_{1} + \\beta_{2}x_{2} + \\epsilon.\n\\]\nCan you write an expression showing how the slope for \\(x_{2}\\) depends on \\(x_{1}\\)?\nFor each configuration of factors, it is better to play several rounds of golf. The more rounds we play, the better our estimates of the effects for each factor. This is a special case of what we discussed in the last notes; the more replicates, the better our estimates.\nMore than 2 factors\nSuppose we want to see how K different binary factors influence golf score. We can no longer visualize the effects as corners of a square, but we can still collect samples for each configuration of factors. This is called a \\(2^K\\) experiment.\nA challenge is that for large K, this means collecting lots of samples\nK = 3 means 8 configurations\nK = 4 means 16\netc.\n\n\ninclude_graphics(\"https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/hwusoeowryssz905tm5qsf6s9vbkxvd9.png\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninclude_graphics(\"https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/2w0x5hzg03zk8113e3rcto58tocc4y6w.png\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninclude_graphics(\"https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/yzxaz23mgvezuny1ybgydrvpxazn3pm2.png\")\n\n\n\n\nExperimental design is often used in characterizing a process; i.e., how do each of the knobs affect the outcome? Alternatively, we may ask a simpler question – are there knobs that have no effect on the outcome? This is called factor screening. An example is the soldering experiment.\n\n\ninclude_graphics(\"https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/da48ixumvvvh51y2mi0b6vkaeczqnsmb.png\")\n\n\n\n\nSometimes we care more about optimization. In this case, we don’t care so much about how each factor influences an outcome; we just want a combination of factors that maximizes it. We can visualize the outcome of hte process as a function of several continuous variables.\nIntuitively, our experimentation should proceed by first making a preliminary test and then proceeding in the direction of the max. This intuition is formalized in response surface methodology.\n\n\ninclude_graphics(\"https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/stgfkm41btsdbnzdxkxs7osnd37hahdj.png\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
